title: nineteen [???] author: george orwell [???] of eric bl air) [???]) part one chapter 1 it was a bright cold day in april [???] and the clocks were striking thirteen. winston smith [???] his chin [???] into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind [???] slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions [???] though not quickly enough to prevent a [???] of gritty dust from entering along with him. the hall way smelt of boiled [???] and old rag mats. at one end of it a coloured poster [???] too large for in door display [???] had been tack ed to the wall. it [???] simply an enormous face [???] more than a met re wide: the face of a man of about [???] [???] with a heavy black [???] and [???] handsome features. winston made for the stairs. it was no use trying the lift. even at the best of times it was seldom working [???] and at present the [???] current was cut off during daylight hours. it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week. the flat was seven flights up [???] and winston [???] who was [???] and had a [???] ulcer above his right ank le [???] went slowly [???] rest ing several times on the way. on each landing [???] opposite the [???] [???] the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. big brother is watching you [???] the caption beneath it ran. inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of [???]. the voice came from an oblong metal [???] like a dull ed mirror which formed part of the surface of the [???] wall. winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat [???] though the words were still distinguish able. the instrument(the telescreen [???] it was called) could be dim med [???] but there was no way of shutting it off completely. he moved over to the window: a smallish [???] frail figure [???] the [???] of his body merely [???] by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. his hair was very fair [???] his face naturally [???] [???] his skin roughened by coarse so ap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. outside [???] even through the shut [???] [???] the world looked cold. down in the street little ed dies of wind were whir ling dust and torn paper into spirals [???] and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue [???] there seemed to be no colour in anything [???] except the posters that were plaster ed everywhere. the [???] face gazed down from every command ing corner. there was one on the [???] immediately opposite. big brother is watching you [???] the caption said [???] while the dark eyes looked deep into [???] own. down at street level another poster [???] torn at one corner [???] flapped fit fully in the wind [???] [???] covering and uncover ing the single word ingsoc. in the far distance a helicop ter sk immed down between the roofs [???] hover ed for an instant like a blue bottle [???] and dart ed away again with a curving flight. it was the police patrol [???] [???] into [???] windows. the patrols did not matter [???] however. only the thought police mattered. behind [???] back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about [???] and the [???] of the ninth [???] plan. the telescreen received and [???] simultaneously. any sound that winston made [???] above the level of a very low whisper [???] would be picked up by it [???] moreover [???] so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal [???] commanded [???] he could be seen as well as heard. there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. how often [???] or on what system [???] the thought police [???] in on any individual wire was guesswork. it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. but at any rate they could pl ug in your wire whenever they wanted to. you had to [???] live [???] from habit that became [???] the [???] that every sound you made was overheard [???] and [???] except in darkness [???] every movement [???]. winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. it was safer; though [???] as he well knew [???] even a back can be reveal ing. a [???] away the ministry of truth [???] his place of work [???] tower ed vast and white above the grimy land scape. this [???] he thought with a sort of vague [???] was london [???] chief city of air strip one [???] itself the third most populous of the [???] of oceania. he tried to [???] out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this. were there always these [???] of rotting [???] houses [???] their sides sho red up with [???] of timber [???] their windows patch ed with cardboard and their roofs with [???] iron [???] their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? and the bomb ed sites where the plaster dust [???] in the air and the [???] [???] over the heaps of rubb le; and the places where the bombs had clear ed a larger patch and there had sprung up sor did [???] of wooden dwellings like [???]? but it was no use [???] he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of [???] tableaux occurring against no background and most ly [???]. the ministry of [???] [???] in newspeak[ newspeak was the official language of oceania. for an account of its structure and [???] see [???] [???] different from any other object in sight. it was an enormous [???] structure of glittering white concrete [???] soaring up [???] terrace after terrace [???] 300 metres into the air. from where winston stood it was just possible to read [???] picked out on its white face in [???] letter ing [???] the three slogans of the party: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the ministry of truth contained [???] it was said [???] three thousand rooms above ground level [???] and [???] [???] below. scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. so completely did they dwarf the [???] [???] that from the roof of victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. they were the hom es of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. the ministry of truth [???] which concerned itself with news [???] entertainment [???] education [???] and the fine arts. the ministry of peace [???] which concerned itself with war. the ministry of love [???] which maintain ed law and order. and the ministry of plenty [???] which was responsible for economic affairs. their names [???] in newspeak: [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???]. the ministry of love was the really frightening one. there were no windows in it at all. winston had never been inside the ministry of love [???] nor within half a [???] of it. it was a place impossible to enter except on official business [???] and then only by [???] through a maze of [???] [???] [???] steel doors [???] and hidden [???] nests. even the streets leading up to its outer [???] were roamed by [???] guards in black uniforms [???] armed with joint ed truncheons. winston turned round abrupt ly. he had set his features into the expression of quiet [???] which it was advis able to wear when fac ing the telescreen. he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lun ch in the canteen [???] and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of [???] bread which had got to be saved for [???] breakfast. he took down from the shelf a bottle of colour less liquid with a plain white la bel marked victory gin. it gave off a sickly [???] oily smell [???] as of chinese [???]. winston pour ed out nearly a [???] [???] nerved himself for a shock [???] and [???] it down like a do se of medicine. instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. the stuff was like [???] ac id [???] and moreover [???] in swallow ing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubb er club. the next moment [???] however [???] the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. he took a cigarette from a [???] packet marked victory cigarettes and [???] held it upright [???] whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. with the next he was more success ful. he went back to the [???] and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. from the table drawer he took out a [???] [???] a bottle of ink [???] and a thick [???] [???] blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. for some reason the telescreen in the [???] was in an unusual position. instead of being placed [???] as was normal [???] in the end wall [???] where it could command the whole room [???] it was in the longer wall [???] opposite the window. to one side of it there was a shallow al cove in which winston was now sitting [???] and which [???] when the flats were built [???] had probably been intended to hold [???]. by sitting in the al cove [???] and keeping well back [???] winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen [???] so far as sight went. he could be heard [???] of course [???] but so long as he stay ed in his present position he could not be seen. it was partly the unusual [???] of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. but it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. it was a peculiar ly beautiful book. its smooth creamy paper [???] a little yellow ed by age [???] was of a kind that had not been [???] for at least forty years past. he could guess [???] however [???] that the book was much older than that. he had seen it lying in the window of a [???] little [???] in a [???] quarter of the town(just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been [???] immediately by an overwhel ming desire to possess it. party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops [???] on the free market' [???] it was called) [???] but the rule was not strict ly kept [???] because there were various things [???] such as [???] and razor blades [???] which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. he had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. even with nothing written in it [???] it was a compromising possession. the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. this was not [???]( nothing was [???] [???] since there were no longer any laws) [???] but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punish ed by death [???] or at least by [???] years in a [???] camp. winston fitted a nib into the [???] and suck ed it to get the gr ease off. the pen was an [???] instrument [???] seldom used even for [???] [???] and he had procured one [???] [???] and with some difficulty [???] simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratch ed with an [???]. actually he was not used to writing by hand. apart from very short notes [???] it was usual to [???] everything into the [???] which was of course impossible for his present purpose. he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. a trem or had gone through his bowels. to mark the paper was the [???] act. in small [???] letters he wrote: april 4th [???] 1984. he sat back. a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. to begin with [???] he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. it must be round about that date [???] since he was fairly sure that his age was [???] [???] and he believed that he had been born in [???] or [???]; but it was never possible [???] to pin down any date within a year or two. for whom [???] it suddenly occurred to him to wonder [???] was he writing this diary? for the future [???] for the unb orn. his mind hover ed for a moment round the doubtful date on the page [???] and then fetch ed up with a bump against the newspeak word doublethink. for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. how could you communic ate with the future? it was of its nature impossible. either the future would resem ble the present [???] in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it [???] and his [???] would be meaning less. for some time he sat gazing stupid ly at the paper. the telescreen had changed over to str ident military music. it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of express ing himself [???] but even to have forgotten what it was that he had original ly intended to say. for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment [???] and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. the actual writing would be easy. all he had to do was to trans fer to paper the interminable restless [???] that had been running inside his head [???] literally for years. at this moment [???] however [???] even the [???] had dried up. moreover his [???] ulcer had begun itching [???]. he dared not scratch it [???] because if he did so it always became inflamed. the seconds were tick ing by. he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him [???] the itching of the skin above his ank le [???] the blaring of the music [???] and a slight [???] caused by the gin. suddenly he began writing in sheer panic [???] only im perfectly aware of what he was setting down. his small but childish hand writing [???] up and down the page [???] shed ding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops: april 4th [???] 1984. last night to the [???]. all war films. one very good one of a ship full of [???] being bomb ed somewhere in the [???]. audience much am used by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicop ter after him [???] first you saw him [???] along in the water like a [???] [???] then you saw him through the helicopters gun sights [???] then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water [???] audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a life boat full of children with a helicop ter hover ing over it. there was a [???] woman might have been a jew ess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to bur row right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comfort ing him although she was blue with fright herself [???] all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicop ter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to match wood. then there was a wonderful shot of a [???] arm going up up up right up into the air a helicop ter with a came ra in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kick ing up a fuss and shouting they didnt ought er of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say [???] prole reaction they [???]- winston stopped writing [???] partly because he was suffering from cramp. he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind [???] to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. it was [???] he now realized [???] because of this other inc ident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today. it had happened that morning at the ministry [???] if anything so [???] could be said to happen. it was nearly eleven hundred [???] and in the records department [???] where winston worked [???] they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and group ing them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen [???] in preparation for the two minutes hate. winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight [???] but had never spoken to [???] came [???] into the room. one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. he did not know her name [???] but he knew that she worked in the fiction department. [???] he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a [???] had some mechanical job on one of the [???] machines. she was a [???] girl [???] of about [???] [???] with thick hair [???] a [???] face [???] and swift [???] [???] movements. a narrow scarlet sash [???] [???] of the junior [???] league [???] was wound several times round the waist of her overalls [???] just tight ly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. he knew the reason. it was because of the [???] of [???] and cold baths and community [???] and general [???] which she managed to carry about with her. he disliked nearly all women [???] and especially the young and pretty ones. it was always the women [???] and above all the young ones [???] who were the most bigot ed [???] of the party [???] the swallowers of slogans [???] the [???] spies and [???] of [???]. but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. once when they passed in the corrid or she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police. that [???] it was true [???] was very unlike ly. still [???] he continued to feel a peculiar [???] [???] which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility [???] whenever she was anywhere near him. the other person was a man named [???] [???] a member of the inner party and hol der of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature. a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approach ing. [???] was a large [???] bur ly man with a thick neck and a coarse [???] humorous [???] bru tal face. in spite of his [???] appearance he had a certain charm of manner. he had a trick of [???] his spectacles on his nose which was curiously [???] some [???] way [???] curiously civilized. it was a gesture which [???] if anyone had still thought in such terms [???] might have recalled an [???] nobleman offering his snuff box. winston had seen [???] perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. he felt deeply drawn to him [???] and not solely because he was [???] by the contrast between [???] [???] manner and his [???] [???]. much more it was because of a secretly held [???] perhaps not even a belief [???] merely a [???] [???] political orthodoxy was not perfect. something in his face suggested it [???]. and again [???] perhaps it was not even [???] that was written in his face [???] but simply intelligence. but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could che at the telescreen and get him alone. winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed [???] there was no way of doing so. at this moment [???] glanced at his [???] [???] saw that it was nearly eleven hundred [???] and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over. he took a chair in the same row as winston [???] a couple of places away. a small [???] [???] woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them. the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind. the next moment a hideous [???] grind ing speech [???] as of some monstrous machine running without oil [???] burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. it was a noise that set [???] teeth on edge and [???] the hair at the back of [???] neck. the hate had started. as usual [???] the face of [???] goldstein [???] the enemy of the people [???] had flash ed on to the screen. there were hisses here and there among the audience. the little [???] woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgu st. goldstein was the [???] and [???] who once [???] long ago(how long ago [???] nobody quite remembered) [???] had been one of the leading figures of the party [???] almost on a level with big brother himself [???] and then had engaged in [???] [???] [???] had been condemned to death [???] and had mysterious ly escaped and disappeared. the [???] of the two minutes hate varied from day to day [???] but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure. he was the prim al traitor [???] the earliest [???] of the [???] purity. all [???] crimes against the party [???] all [???] [???] acts of [???] [???] heresies [???] [???] [???] spr ang directly out of his teaching. somewhere or other he was still alive and hatch ing his [???]: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea [???] under the protection of his foreign pay masters [???] perhaps [???] it was occasionally [???] some [???] in oceania itself. [???] [???] was [???]. he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. it was a lean je wish face [???] with a great [???] [???] of white hair and a small [???] [???] cle ver face [???] and yet somehow inherently [???] [???] with a kind of sen ile silliness in the long thin nose [???] near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. it resembled the face of a sheep [???] and the voice [???] too [???] had a [???] quality. goldstein was deliver ing his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the [???] attack so [???] and per verse that a child should have been able to see through it [???] and yet just [???] enough to fill one with an alar med feeling that other people [???] less [???] than one self [???] might be taken in by it. he was abus ing big brother [???] he was denouncing the [???] of the party [???] he was demand ing the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia [???] he was [???] freedom of speech [???] freedom of the press [???] freedom of assembly [???] freedom of thought [???] he was crying [???] that the revolution had been [???] all this in rap id [???] speech which was a sort of [???] of the habitual style of the orators of the party [???] and even contained newspeak words: more newspeak words [???] indeed [???] than any party member would normal ly use in real life. and all the while [???] lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which [???] specious [???] covered [???] behind his head on the telescreen there march ed the endless [???] of the eurasian [???] after row of [???] men with expression less [???] faces [???] who sw am up to the surface of the screen and vanished [???] to be replaced by others exactly similar. the dull [???] tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to [???] bleating voice. before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds [???] [???] [???] of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. the [???] [???] face on the screen [???] and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it [???] were too much to be borne: besides [???] the sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger [???]. he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia [???] since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other. but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everybody [???] although every day and a thousand times a day [???] on platforms [???] on the telescreen [???] in newspapers [???] in books [???] his theories were refuted [???] smash ed [???] ridiculed [???] held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they [???] spite of all this [???] his influence never seemed to grow less. always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. a day never passed when spies and [???] acting under his directions were not unm asked by the thought police. he was the commander of a vast shadowy army [???] an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state. the brotherhood [???] its name was supposed to be. there were also whispered stories of a terrible book [???] a [???] of all the heresies [???] of which goldstein was the author and which circulated [???] here and there. it was a book without a title. people referred to it [???] if at all [???] simply as the book. but one knew of such things only through vague rumours. neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoid ing it. in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy. people were leap ing up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the [???] bleating voice that came from the screen. the little [???] woman had turned bright pink [???] and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. even [???] heavy face was [???]. he was sitting very straight in his chair [???] his powerful chest swelling and [???] as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. the [???] girl behind winston had begun crying out' swine! swine! swine!' and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. it struck [???] nose and bounced off; the voice continued [???]. in a luc id moment winston found that he was shouting with the others and kick ing his heel violently against the rung of his chair. the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part [???] but [???] on the contrary [???] that it was impossible to avoid join ing in. within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. a hideous ecstasy of fear and [???] [???] a desire to kill [???] to torture [???] to smash faces in with a [???] [???] seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an [???] current [???] turning one even against [???] will into a [???] [???] screaming lunatic. and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract [???] un directed emotion which could be [???] from one object to another like the flame of a blow lamp. thus [???] at one moment [???] hatred was not turned against goldstein at all [???] but [???] on the contrary [???] against big brother [???] the party [???] and the thought police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely [???] derided heretic on the screen [???] sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him [???] and all that was said of goldstein seemed to him to be true. at those moments his secret loath ing of big brother changed into adoration [???] and big brother seemed to tower up [???] an [???] [???] fear less protector [???] standing like a rock against the hor des of asia [???] and goldstein [???] in spite of his [???] [???] his helplessness [???] and the doubt that hung about his very existence [???] seemed like some sinister enchant er [???] capable by the mere power of his voice of wreck ing the structure of civilization. it was even possible [???] at moments [???] to switch [???] hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. suddenly [???] by the sort of violent effort with which one wrench es [???] head away from the pillow in a night mare [???] winston succeeded in [???] his hatred from the face on the screen to the [???] girl behind him. vivid [???] beautiful [???] flash ed through his mind. he would flog her to death with a rubb er trunche on. he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian. he would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of clim ax. better than before [???] moreover [???] he realized why it was that he hated her. he hated her because she was young and pretty and sex less [???] because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so [???] because round her sweet supple waist [???] which seemed to ask you to en circle it with your arm [???] there was only the odious scarlet sash [???] [???] [???] of chastity. the hate rose to its clim ax. the voice of goldstein had become an actual [???] ble at [???] and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. then the [???] melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing [???] huge and terrible [???] his [???] gun roaring [???] and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen [???] so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. but in the same moment [???] drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody [???] the host ile figure melted into the face of big brother [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] full of power and mysterious calm [???] and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. nobody heard what big brother was saying. it was merely a few words of encourage ment [???] the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle [???] not distinguish able individual ly but restor ing confidence by the fact of being spoken. then the face of big brother faded away again [???] and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen [???] as though the impact that it had made on [???] eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. the little [???] woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. with a tremulous murmur that sounded like' my [???]' she extended her arms towards the screen. then she buried her face in her hands. it was apparent that she was utter ing a prayer. at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep [???] slow [???] [???] chant of [???] and over again [???] very slowly [???] with a long pause between the first'b' and the [???] heavy [???] murmurous sound [???] somehow curiously savage [???] in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the [???] of [???]. for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhel ming emotion. partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother [???] but still more it was an act of [???] [???] a deliberate drown ing of consciousness by means of [???] noise. [???] entrails seemed to grow cold. in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general [???] [???] but this [???] chant ing of [???]' always filled him with horror. of course he chant ed with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. to dissemble your feelings [???] to control your face [???] to do what everyone else was doing [???] was an instinctive reaction. but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might [???] have betrayed him. and it was exactly at this moment that the [???] thing [???] [???] indeed [???] it did happen. momentarily he caught [???] eye. [???] had stood up. he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of [???] them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met [???] and for as long as it took to happen winston [???] [???] he [???] [???] was thinking the same thing as himself. an [???] message had passed. it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes.'i am with [???]' [???] seemed to be saying to him.'i know precise ly what you are feeling. i know all about your contempt [???] your hatred [???] your disgu st. but [???] wor ry [???] i am on your side!' and then the flash of intelligence was gone [???] and [???] face was as [???] as everybody [???]. that was all [???] and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. such incidents never had any [???]. all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief [???] or hope [???] that others besides himself were the enemies of the party. perhaps the rumours of vast underground [???] were true after [???] the brotherhood really existed! it was impossible [???] in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions [???] to be sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth. some days he believed in it [???] some days not. there was no evidence [???] only fleet ing [???] that might mean anything or nothing: snatch es of overheard conversation [???] faint [???] on lavatory [???] [???] even [???] when two strangers met [???] a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. it was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. he had gone back to his cubicle without looking at [???] again. the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. it would have been [???] dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. for a second [???] two seconds [???] they had exchanged an [???] glance [???] and that was the end of the story. but even that was a memor able event [???] in the locked loneliness in which one had to live. winston rou sed himself and sat up straight er. he let out a bel ch. the gin was rising from his stomach. his eyes [???] on the page. he discovered that while he sat helpless ly musing he had also been writing [???] as though by [???] action. and it was no longer the same [???] [???] [???] hand writing as before. his pen had slid [???] over the smooth paper [???] print ing in large neat [???]- down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again [???] filling half a page. he could not help feeling a twin ge of panic. it was absurd [???] since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the [???] act of opening the diary [???] but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoil ed pages and abandon the enterprise altogether. he did not do so [???] however [???] because he knew that it was useless. whether he wrote down with big brother [???] or whether he [???] from writing it [???] made no difference. whether he went on with the diary [???] or whether he did not go on with it [???] made no difference. the thought police would get him just the same. he had [???] still have committed [???] even if he had never set pen to [???] essential crime that contained all others in itself. thoughtcrime [???] they called it. thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever. you might [???] success fully for a while [???] even for years [???] but sooner or later they were bound to get you. it was always at [???] arrests invariably happened at night. the sudden jerk out of sleep [???] the rough hand shaking your shoulder [???] the lights glaring in your eyes [???] the ring of hard faces round the bed. in the vast majority of cases there was no trial [???] no report of the arrest. people simply disappeared [???] always during the night. your name was removed from the [???] [???] every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out [???] your [???] existence was denied and then forgotten. you were abolished [???] [???]: vaporized was the usual word. for a moment he was seized by a kind of [???]. he began writing in a hurried [???] [???]: they ll shoot me i [???] care they ll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big [???]- he sat back in his chair [???] slightly ashamed of himself [???] and laid down the pen. the next moment he started violently. there was a knocking at the door. already! he sat as still as a mouse [???] in the fut ile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt. but no [???] the knocking was repeated. the worst thing of all would be to delay. his heart was thump ing like a drum [???] but his face [???] from long habit [???] was probably expression less. he got up and moved heavily towards the door. chapter 2 as he put his hand to the [???] winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table. down with big brother was written all over it [???] in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. it was an [???] stupid thing to have done. but [???] he realized [???] even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet. he drew in his breath and opened the door. instantly a warm wave of relief flow ed through him. a colour less [???] [???] woman [???] with wis py hair and a lin ed face [???] was standing outside.' oh [???] [???]' she began in a dreary [???] whining sort of voice [???]'i thought i heard you come in. do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? [???] got blocked up [???]' it was mrs parsons [???] the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. [???]' was a word somewhat [???] by the [???] were supposed to call everyone [???] with some women one used it [???]) she was a woman of about thirty [???] but looking much older. one had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. winston followed her down the passage. these [???] repair jobs were an almost daily [???]. victory mansions were old flats [???] built in [???] or thereabouts [???] and were falling to pieces. the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls [???] the pipes burst in every hard frost [???] the roof leaked whenever there was snow [???] the heat ing system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy. repairs [???] except what you could do for yourself [???] had to be [???] by remote [???] which were liable to hold up even the mend ing of a [???] for two years.'of course [???] only because tom [???] [???]' said mrs parsons vaguely. the parsons' flat was bigger than [???] [???] and dingy in a different way. everything had a batter ed [???] [???] look [???] as though the place had just been visited by some large violent anim al. games [???] [???] [???] [???] a burst foot ball [???] a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside [???] all over the floor [???] and on the table there was a lit ter of dirty dishes and [???] [???]. on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies [???] and a [???] poster of big brother. there was the usual [???] smell [???] common to the whole building [???] but it was shot through by a sharp er reek of sweat [???] [???] knew this at the first sniff [???] though it was hard to say [???] the sweat of some person not present at the moment. in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toil et paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issu ing from the telescreen. [???] the [???]' said mrs parsons [???] casting a [???] glance at the door.' they [???] been out today. and of [???]' she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. the kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of [???]. winston kne lt down and examined the [???] of the pipe. he hated using his hands [???] and he hated bending down [???] which was always liable to start him cough ing. mrs parsons looked on helpless ly.'of course if tom was home [???] put it right in a [???]' she said.'he loves anything like that. [???] ever so good with his hands [???] tom is.' parsons was [???] [???] at the ministry of truth. he was a [???] but active man of [???] stupidity [???] a mass of [???] [???] of those completely [???] [???] devoted [???] on whom [???] more even than on the thought police [???] the stability of the party depend ed. at [???] he had just been unwilling ly [???] from the youth league [???] and before [???] into the youth league he had managed to stay on in the spies for a year beyond the [???] age. at the ministry he was employ ed in some [???] post for which intelligence was not required [???] but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sports committ ee and all the other [???] engaged in organizing community [???] [???] [???] demonstrations [???] savings [???] [???] and voluntary [???] generally. he would inform you with quiet pride [???] between [???] of his pipe [???] that he had put in an appearance at the community centre every evening for the past four years. an [???] smell of sweat [???] a sort of unconscious testimony to the [???] of his life [???] followed him about wherever he went [???] and even remained behind him after he had gone.' have you got a [???]' said winston [???] fiddling with the nut on the [???].'a [???]' said mrs parsons [???] immediately becoming [???].'i [???] know [???] [???] sure. perhaps the [???]' there was a tramp ling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the [???]. mrs parsons brought the span ner. winston let out the water and [???] removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. he clean ed his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.'up with your hands!' yell ed a savage voice. a handsome [???] [???] boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was [???] him with a toy [???] pistol [???] while his small sister [???] about two years younger [???] made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. both of them were dressed in the blue shorts [???] grey shirts [???] and red [???] which were the uniform of the spies. winston raised his hands above his head [???] but with an uneasy feeling [???] so vicious was the [???] demean our [???] that it was not altogether a game. [???] a traitor!' yell ed the boy. [???] a [???]! [???] a eurasian spy! [???] shoot you [???] [???] vaporize you [???] [???] send you to the salt [???]' suddenly they were both leap ing round him [???] shouting [???]' and [???]' the little girl imitating her brother in every movement. it was somehow slightly frightening [???] like the [???] of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into [???]. there was a sort of calculating [???] in the [???] eye [???] a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. it was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding [???] winston thought. mrs parsons' eyes flitted nervous ly from winston to the children [???] and back again. in the better light of the [???] he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.' they do get so [???]' she said. [???] disappointed because they [???] go to see the hanging [???] [???] what it is. [???] too busy to take them. and tom [???] be back from work in time.'' why [???] we go and see the hanging?' roar ed the boy in his huge voice.' want to see the hanging! want to see the hanging!' chant ed the little girl [???] still capering round. some eurasian prisoners [???] guilty of war crimes [???] were to be hanged in the park that evening [???] winston remembered. this happened about once a month [???] and was a popular spectacle. children always clamour ed to be taken to see it. he took his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door. but he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an [???] painful blow. it was as though a [???] wire had been [???] into him. he sp un round just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son back into the door way while the boy pocket ed a [???]. [???]' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. but what most struck winston was the look of helpless fright on the [???] greyish face. back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again [???] still rubb ing his neck. the music from the telescreen had stopped. instead [???] a clipped military voice was reading out [???] with a sort of bru tal relish [???] a description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchor ed between ice land and the faroe islands. with those children [???] he thought [???] that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. another year [???] two years [???] and they would be watching her night and day for [???] of [???]. nearly all children [???] were horrible. what was worst of all was that by means of such [???] as the spies they were systematically turned into [???] little savages [???] and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party. on the contrary [???] they ador ed the party and everything connected with it. the songs [???] the processions [???] the banners [???] the [???] [???] the drilling with dum my [???] [???] the yell ing of slogans [???] the worship of big [???] was all a sort of glorious game to them. all their [???] was turned outwards [???] against the enemies of the state [???] against foreigners [???] traitors [???] [???] [???] [???]. it was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. and with good reason [???] for hardly a week passed in which'the times' did not carry a [???] describing how some [???] little [???] hero' was the phrase generally [???] overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the thought police. the sting of the [???] bullet had worn off. he picked up his pen [???] [???] wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary. suddenly he began thinking of [???] again. years [???] long was it? seven years it must [???] had dream ed that he was walking through a [???] room. and someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed:'we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.' it was said very quietly [???] almost [???] statement [???] not a command. he had walked on without pa using. what was curious was that at the time [???] in the dream [???] the words had not made much impression on him. it was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on [???]. he could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen [???] for the first time [???] nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as [???]. but at any rate the identification existed. it was [???] who had spoken to him out of the dark. winston had never been able to feel [???] after this [???] flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether [???] was a friend or an enemy. nor did it even seem to matter greatly. there was a link of understanding between them [???] more important than affection or [???].'we shall meet in the place where there is no [???]' he had said. winston did not know what it meant [???] only that in some way or another it would come true. the voice from the telescreen paused. a trumpet call [???] clear and beautiful [???] floated into the [???] air. the voice continued [???]:' attention! your attention [???] please! a news flash has this moment arrived from the [???] front. our forces in south india have won a glorious victory. i am authorized to say that the action we are now report ing may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. here is the [???]' bad news coming [???] thought winston. and sure enough [???] following on a go ry description of the [???] of a eurasian army [???] with [???] figures of killed and prisoners [???] came the announce ment that [???] as from next week [???] the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty gramm es to twenty. winston belched again. the gin was wearing off [???] leaving a [???] feeling. the [???] to celebr ate the victory [???] perhaps to drown the memory of the lost [???] into' oceania [???]'tis for thee'. you were supposed to stand to attention. however [???] in his present position he was invisible.' oceania [???]'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music. winston walked over to the window [???] keeping his back to the telescreen. the day was still cold and clear. somewhere far away a rocket bomb explo ded with a dull [???] [???] roar. about twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on london at present. down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro [???] and the word ingsoc fit fully appeared and vanished. ingsoc. the sacred principles of ingsoc. newspeak [???] doublethink [???] the mut ability of the past. he felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom [???] lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. he was alone. the past was dead [???] the future was [???]. what certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? and what way of knowing that the dominion of the party would not endure for ever? like an answer [???] the three slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back to him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength he took a [???] cent piece out of his pocket. there [???] too [???] in tiny clear letter ing [???] the same slogans were [???] [???] and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother. even from the coin the eyes pursued you. on coins [???] on stamps [???] on the cove rs of books [???] on banners [???] on posters [???] and on the [???] of a cigarette [???]. always the eyes watching you and the voice [???] you. asleep or awake [???] working or eating [???] in doors or out of doors [???] in the bath or in [???] escape. nothing was your own except the few cubic [???] inside your skull. the sun had shift ed round [???] and the [???] windows of the ministry of truth [???] with the light no longer shining on them [???] looked grim as the [???] of a fortress. his heart [???] before the enormous [???] shape. it was too strong [???] it could not be stor med. a thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. he wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. for the future [???] for the [???] an age that might be imaginary. and in front of him there lay not death but [???]. the diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour. only the thought police would read what he had written [???] before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. how could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you [???] not even an [???] word [???] on a piece of paper [???] could physical ly survive? the telescreen struck fourteen. he must leave in ten minutes. he had to be back at work by [???]. curiously [???] the chim ing of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him. he was a lonely ghost utter ing a truth that nobody would ever hear. but so long as he uttered it [???] in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human [???]. he went back to the table [???] dipped his pen [???] and wrote: to the future or to the past [???] to a time when thought is free [???] when men are different from one another and do not live [???] a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: from the age of uniformity [???] from the age of solitude [???] from the age of big brother [???] from the age of [???]! he was already dead [???] he reflected. it seemed to him that it was only now [???] when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts [???] that he had taken the [???] step. the consequences of every act are included in the act itself. he wrote: thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death. now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible. two fingers of his right hand were ink stained. it was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. some nosing zealot in the ministry(a woman [???] probably: someone like the little [???] woman or the [???] girl from the fiction department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lun ch interv al [???] why he had used an [???] pen [???] what he had been [???] then drop a hint in the [???] quarter. he went to the bathroom and carefully [???] the ink away with the gritty [???] so ap which rasped your skin like sand paper and was therefore well [???] for this purpose. he put the diary away in the drawer. it was quite useless to think of hiding it [???] but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered. a hair laid across the [???] was too obvious. with the tip of his finger he picked up an [???] grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover [???] where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved. chapter 3 winston was dream ing of his mother. he must [???] he thought [???] have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. she was a tall [???] statue sque [???] rather silent woman with slow movements and [???] fair hair. his father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin [???] dressed always in neat dark clothes( winston remembered especially the very thin sol es of his [???] shoes) and wearing spectacles. the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purg es of the fifties. at this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him [???] with his young sister in her arms. he did not remember his sister at all [???] except as a tiny [???] feeble baby [???] always silent [???] with large [???] watchful eyes. both of them were looking up at him. they were down in some [???] [???] bottom of a well [???] for instance [???] or a very deep [???] it was a place which [???] already far below him [???] was itself moving downwards. they were in the saloon of a sinking ship [???] looking up at him through the darkening water. there was still air in the saloon [???] they could still see him and he them [???] but all the while they were sinking down [???] down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever. he was out in the light and air while they were being suck ed down to death [???] and they were down there because he was up here. he knew it and they knew it [???] and he could see the knowledge in their faces. there was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts [???] only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive [???] and that this was part of the [???] order of things. he could not remember what had happened [???] but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. it was one of those dreams which [???] while retain ing the characteristic dream scene ry [???] are a continuation of [???] intellectual life [???] and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and [???] after one is awake. the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that his [???] death [???] nearly thirty years ago [???] had been tragic and sorrow ful in a way that was no longer possible. tragedy [???] he perceived [???] belong ed to the ancient time [???] to a time when there was still privacy [???] love [???] and friendship [???] and when the members of a family stood by one another without need ing to know the reason. his [???] memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him [???] when he was too young and sel fish to love her in return [???] and because somehow [???] he did not remember how [???] she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and [???]. such things [???] he saw [???] could not happen today. today there were fear [???] hatred [???] and pain [???] but no dignity of emotion [???] no deep or complex sorrows. all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister [???] looking up at him through the green water [???] hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking. suddenly he was standing on short springy turf [???] on a summer evening when the [???] rays of the sun gilded the ground. the land scape that he was looking at [???] so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country. it was an old [???] [???] pasture [???] with a [???] wandering across it and a mole hill here and there. in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were sway ing very faintly in the breeze [???] their leaves just stirring in den se masses like [???] hair. somewhere near at hand [???] though out of sight [???] there was a clear [???] [???] stream where da ce were swim ming in the [???] under the willow trees. the girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. with what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdain fully aside. her body was white and smooth [???] but it [???] no desire in him [???] indeed he barely looked at it. what overwhel med him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. with its grace and carelessness it seemed to [???] a whole [???] [???] a whole system of thought [???] as though big brother and the party and the thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single [???] movement of the arm. that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. winston woke up with the word [???]' on his lips. the telescreen was giving forth an [???] whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. it was nought seven fifteen [???] [???] time for office workers. winston wrench ed his body out of [???] [???] for a member of the outer party received only [???] clo thing [???] annually [???] and a suit of [???] was [???] seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. the physical jerks would begin in three minutes. the next moment he was doub led up by a violent cough ing fit which nearly always attack ed him soon after waking up. it emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep [???]. his veins had swell ed with the effort of the cough [???] and the [???] ulcer had started itching.' thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice.' thirty to forty group! take your places [???] please. thirties to [???]' winston spr ang to attention in front of the telescreen [???] upon which the image of a youngish woman [???] scrawny but [???] [???] dressed in tunic and [???] [???] had already appeared.' arms bending and [???]' she rapped out.' take your time by me. one [???] two [???] three [???] four! one [???] two [???] three [???] four! come on [???] comrades [???] put a bit of life into it! one [???] two [???] three four! one two [???] three [???] [???]' the pain of the cough ing fit had not quite driven out of [???] mind the impression made by his dream [???] and the [???] movements of the exercise restor ed it somewhat. as he mechanical ly shot his arms back and forth [???] wearing on his face the look of grim enjoy ment which was considered proper during the physical jerks [???] he was strugg ling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. it was [???] difficult. beyond the late fifties everything faded. when there were no external records that you could refer to [???] even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. you remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened [???] you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to [???] their [???] [???] and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. everything had been different then. even the names of countries [???] and their shapes on the map [???] had been different. air strip one [???] for instance [???] had not been so called in those days: it had been called england or britain [???] though london [???] he felt fairly certain [???] had always been called london. winston could not definite ly remember a time when his country had not been at war [???] but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interv al of peace during his childhood [???] because one of his early memories was of an air ra id which appeared to take everyone by surprise. perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester. he did not remember the ra id itself [???] but he did remember his [???] hand clutch ing his own as they hurried down [???] down [???] down into some place deep in the earth [???] round and round a spir al staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began [???] and they had to stop and rest. his mother [???] in her slow [???] dreamy way [???] was following a long way behind them. she was carrying his baby [???] perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then. finally they had [???] into a noisy [???] crowded place which he had realized to be a tube station. there were people sitting all over the [???] floor [???] and other people [???] pack ed tight ly together [???] were sitting on metal [???] [???] one above the other. winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor [???] and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a b unk. the old man had on a dec ent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. he reek ed of gin. it seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat [???] and one could have fancied that the tears wel ling from his eyes were pure gin. but though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was [???] and [???]. in his childish way winston grasp ed that some terrible thing [???] something that was beyond forgiven ess and could never be [???] [???] had just happened. it also seemed to him that he knew what it was. someone whom the old man [???] little grand daughter [???] [???] been killed. every few minutes the old man kept repeat ing:'we [???] ought to' ave trusted' em. i said so [???] ma [???] [???] i? [???] what comes of trust ing' em. i said so all along. we [???] ought to' ave trusted the [???]' but which [???] they [???] ought to have trusted winston could not now remember. since about that time [???] war had been literally continuous [???] though strict ly speaking it had not always been the same war. for several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself [???] some of which he remembered vivid ly. but to trace out the history of the whole period [???] to say who was fighting whom at any given moment [???] would have been utterly impossible [???] since no written record [???] and no spoken word [???] ever made mention of any other [???] than the exist ing one. at this moment [???] for example [???] in 1984(if it was [???] [???] oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia. in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been group ed along different lines. actually [???] as winston well knew [???] it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia. but that was merely a piece of [???] knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not [???] under control. official ly the change of partners had never happened. oceania was at war with eurasia: therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia. the enemy of the moment always represent ed absolute evil [???] and it followed that any past or future agree ment with him was impossible. the frightening thing [???] he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painful ly backward(with hands on hips [???] they were [???] their bodies from the waist [???] an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back [???] frightening thing was that it might all be true. if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event [???] it never [???] [???] surely [???] was more terrifying than mere torture and death? the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia. he [???] winston smith [???] knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago. but where did that knowledge exist? only in his own consciousness [???] which in any case must soon be [???]. and if all others accepted the lie which the party [???] all records told the same [???] the lie passed into history and became truth.' who controls the [???]' ran the party slog an [???]' controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' and yet the past [???] though of its nature alter able [???] never had been altered. whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. it was quite simple. all that was needed was an un ending series of victories over your own memory.' reality control' [???] they called it: in newspeak [???] [???].'stand easy!' bark ed the instructress [???] a little more genially. winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. his mind slid away into the [???] world of doublethink. to know and not to know [???] to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully [???] lies [???] to hold simultaneously two opinions which [???] out [???] knowing them to be contradictory and believ ing in both of them [???] to use logic against logic [???] to [???] morality while laying claim to it [???] to believe that [???] was impossible and that the party was the guardian of [???] [???] to forget whatever it was necessary to forget [???] then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed [???] and then prompt ly to forget it again: and above all [???] to apply the same process to the process itself. that was the ultimate subtle ty: conscious ly to induce unconsciousness [???] and then [???] once again [???] to become unconscious of the act of [???] you had just performed. even to understand the word' doublethink' involved the use of doublethink. the instructress had called them to attention again.'and now [???] see which of us can touch our [???]' she said [???].'right over from the hips [???] please [???] comrades. [???]! [???]' winston loathed this exercise [???] which sent shoot ing pains all the way from his heels to his [???] and often ended by bringing on another cough ing fit. the [???] quality went out of his meditations. the past [???] he reflected [???] had not merely been altered [???] it had been actually destroyed. for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother. he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties [???] but it was impossible to be certain. in the party histories [???] of course [???] big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days. his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties [???] when the capitalists in their strange [???] hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming [???] or horse carriages with glass sides. there was no knowing how much of this leg end was true and how much invented. winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence. he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before 1960 [???] but it was possible that in its oldspeak [???] [???] [???] that is to [???] had been current earlier. everything melted into mist. sometimes [???] indeed [???] you could put your finger on a definite lie. it was not true [???] for example [???] as was claim ed in the party history books [???] that the party had invented [???]. he remembered [???] since his earliest childhood. but you could prove nothing. there was never any evidence. just once in his whole life he had held in his hands [???] [???] proof of the falsification of an [???] fact. and on that [???]- [???]' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. [???] smith w.! yes [???] you! bend lower [???] please! you can do better than that. [???] not trying. lower [???] please! [???] better [???] comrade. now stand at ease [???] the whole squ ad [???] and watch me.' a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over [???] body. his face remained completely [???]. never show dismay! never show [???]! a single [???] of the eyes could give you away. he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head [???] could not say grace fully [???] but with remarkable neatness and [???] over and tuck ed the first joint of her fingers under her toes.' there [???] comrades! [???] how i want to see you doing it. watch me again. [???] [???] and [???] had four children. now look.' she bent over again.' you see my knees [???] bent. you can all do it if you want [???]' she added as she straightened herself up.' anyone under [???] is perfectly capable of touching his toes. we [???] all have the privilege of fighting in the front line [???] but at least we can all keep fit. remember our boys on the [???] front! and the sailors in the floating fortress es! just think what they have to put up with. now try again. [???] better [???] comrade [???] [???] much [???]' she added [???] as winston [???] with a violent lun ge [???] succeeded in touching his toes with knees unb ent [???] for the first time in several years. chapter 4 with the deep [???] unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from utter ing when his [???] work started [???] winston pulled the speakwrite towards him [???] blew the dust from its mouthpiece [???] and put on his spectacles. then he unrolled and clipped together four small [???] of paper which had already flopped out of the [???] tube on the [???] side of his desk. in the walls of the cubicle there were three [???]. to the right of the speakwrite [???] a small [???] tube for written messages [???] to the left [???] a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall [???] within easy reach of [???] arm [???] a large oblong slit protect ed by a wire grat ing. this last was for the dispos al of waste paper. similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building [???] not only in every room but at short intervals in every corrid or. for some reason they were nick named memory holes. when one knew that any [???] was due for destruction [???] or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about [???] it was an [???] action to lift the fl ap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in [???] whereupon it would be whir led away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building. winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. each contained a message of only one or two lines [???] in the [???] [???] actually newspeak [???] but consist ing large ly of newspeak [???] was used in the ministry for [???] purposes. they ran: times [???] bb speech mal reported africa rectify times [???] [???] 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue times [???] [???] [???] chocolate rectify times [???] report ing bb day order [???] refs un persons rewrite fullwise up sub [???] with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside. it was an [???] and responsible job and had better be dealt with last. the other three were rout ine matters [???] though the second one would probably mean some tedious wa ding through lists of figures. winston dial led' back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the [???] issu es of'the times' [???] which slid out of the [???] tube after only a few minutes' delay. the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter [???] or [???] as the official phrase had it [???] to rectify. for example [???] it appeared from'the times' of the [???] of march that big brother [???] in his speech of the previous day [???] had [???] that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be [???] in north africa. as it happened [???] the eurasian higher command had [???] its offensive in south india and left north africa alone. it was therefore necessary to rewrite a [???] of big [???] speech [???] in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. or again [???]'the times' of the nineteenth of december had publish ed the official [???] of the out put of various class es of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of [???] [???] which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth [???] plan. [???] issue contained a statement of the actual out put [???] from which it appeared that the [???] were in every instance grossly wrong. [???] job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. as for the third message [???] it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. as short a time ago as [???] [???] the ministry of plenty had issu ed a promise(a [???] pledge' were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. actually [???] as winston was aware [???] the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty gramm es to twenty at the end of the present week. all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april. as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages [???] he clipped his speak written corrections to the [???] copy of'the times' and pushed them into the [???] tube. then [???] with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious [???] he [???] up the original message and any notes that he himself had made [???] and dropped them into the memory hole to be devour ed by the flames. what happened in the unseen [???] to which the [???] tubes led [???] he did not know in detail [???] but he did know in general terms. as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of'the times' had been assembled and collat ed [???] that number would be [???] [???] the original copy destroyed [???] and the correct ed copy placed on the files in its stead. this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers [???] but to books [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] posters [???] leaf lets [???] films [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] every kind of literature or [???] which might [???] hold any political or ideological [???]. day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by [???] evidence to have been correct [???] nor was any item of news [???] or any expression of opinion [???] which conflict ed with the needs of the moment [???] ever allowed to remain on record. all history was a [???] [???] scraped clean and [???] exactly as often as was necessary. in no case would it have been possible [???] once the deed was done [???] to prove that any falsification had taken place. the lar gest section of the records department [???] far larger than the one on which winston worked [???] consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books [???] newspapers [???] and other [???] which had been [???] and were due for destruction. a number of'the times' which might [???] because of changes in political [???] [???] or mistaken [???] uttered by big brother [???] have been re written a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date [???] and no other copy existed to contradict it. books [???] also [???] were recalled and re written again and again [???] and were invariably [???] without any admission that any alteration had been made. even the written instructions which winston received [???] and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them [???] never stat ed or implied that an act of forge ry was to be committed: always the reference was to slips [???] errors [???] misprints [???] or [???] which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy. but actually [???] he thought as he [???] the ministry of [???] figures [???] it was not even forge ry. it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. most of the material that you were dealing with had no [???] with anything in the real world [???] not even the kind of [???] that is contained in a direct lie. [???] were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. for example [???] the ministry of [???] forecast had estimated the out put of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. the actual out put was given as [???] millions. winston [???] however [???] in re writing the forecast [???] marked the figure down to [???] millions [???] so as to allow for the usual claim that the [???] had been [???]. in any case [???] [???] millions was no nearer the truth than [???] millions [???] or than 145 millions. very likely no boots had been produced at all. likelier still [???] nobody knew how many had been produced [???] much less cared. all one knew was that every quarter [???] numbers of boots were produced on paper [???] while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot. and so it was with every class of record ed fact [???] great or small. everything faded away into a [???] in which [???] finally [???] even the date of the year had become uncertain. winston glanced across the hall. in the [???] cubicle on the other side a small [???] [???] [???] [???] man named [???] was working steadily away [???] with a folded newspap er on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. he looked up [???] and his spectacles dart ed a host ile flash in [???] direction. winston hardly knew [???] [???] and had no idea what work he was employ ed on. people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs. in the long [???] window less hall [???] with its double row of cubicles and its endless rust le of papers and hum of voices murmur ing into speakwrites [???] there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name [???] though he daily saw them hurry ing to and fro in the corridors or [???] in the two minutes hate. he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toil ed day in day out [???] simply at track ing down and [???] from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. there was a certain fitness in this [???] since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. and a few cubicles away a mild [???] [???] [???] dreamy creature named ampleforth [???] with very hairy ears and a surpris ing tal ent for [???] with rhymes and metres [???] was engaged in producing garbled [???] texts [???] they were [???] [???] which had become ideologically offensive [???] but which for one reason or another were to be retain ed in the [???]. and this hall [???] with its fifty workers or thereabouts [???] was only one [???] [???] a single cell [???] as it were [???] in the huge complexity of the records department. beyond [???] above [???] below [???] were other swarms of workers engaged in an [???] multitude of jobs. there were the huge [???] with their [???] [???] their [???] experts [???] and their [???] equipped [???] for the faking of photographs. there was the [???] section with its engineers [???] its produce rs [???] and its teams of actors special ly chosen for their skill in imitating voices. there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and [???] which were due for recall. there were the vast [???] where the correct ed [???] were stor ed [???] and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. and somewhere or other [???] quite [???] [???] there were the direct ing brains who [???] the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved [???] that one falsified [???] and the other rubb ed out of existence. and the records department [???] after all [???] was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth [???] whose primary job was not to recon struct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers [???] films [???] text books [???] telescreen [???] [???] plays [???] [???] every conceivable kind of information [???] instruction [???] or entertainment [???] from a statue to a slog an [???] from a lyric po em to a [???] treatise [???] and from a [???] [???] to a newspeak dictionary. and the ministry had not only to supply the [???] needs of the party [???] but also to repeat the whole ope ration at a lower level for the benefit of the [???]. there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with [???] literature [???] music [???] drama [???] and entertainment generally. here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport [???] crime and [???] [???] sensation al [???] [???] [???] films oozing with sex [???] and [???] songs which were compos ed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of [???] known as a [???]. there was even a whole [???] [???] it was called in [???] in producing the low est kind of [???] [???] which was sent out in seal ed packets and which no party member [???] other than those who worked on it [???] was permit ted to look at. three messages had slid out of the [???] tube while winston was working [???] but they were simple matters [???] and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him. when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle [???] took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf [???] pushed the speakwrite to one side [???] clean ed his spectacles [???] and settled down to his main job of the morning. [???] greatest pleasure in life was in his work. most of it was a tedious rout ine [???] but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and [???] that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a [???] [???] pieces of forge ry in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estim ate of what the party wanted you to say. winston was good at this kind of thing. on occasion he had even been en trusted with the rectification of'the times' leading articles [???] which were written entirely in newspeak. he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. it ran: times [???] report ing bb day order [???] refs un persons rewrite fullwise up sub [???] in oldspeak( or standard english) this might be rendered: the report ing of big [???] order for the day in'the times' of december [???] [???] is extremely [???] and makes references to [???] persons. rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before fi ling. winston read through the offend ing article. big [???] order for the day [???] it seemed [???] had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as [???] [???] which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortress es. a certain comrade withers [???] a prominent member of the inner party [???] had been singled out for special mention and awarded a [???] [???] the order of [???] merit [???] second class. three months later [???] had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace [???] but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen. that was to be expected [???] since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. the great purg es involving thousands of people [???] with public trials of traitors and [???] who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed [???] were special [???] not occurring often er than once in a couple of years. more common ly [???] people who had incur red the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. in some cases they might not even be dead. perhaps thirty people personal ly known to winston [???] not counting his parents [???] had disappeared at one time or another. winston stroked his nose gently with a [???]. in the cubicle across the way comrade [???] was still [???] secretively over his speakwrite. he raised his head for a moment: again the host ile [???]. winston wondered whether comrade [???] was engaged on the same job as himself. it was perfectly possible. so tricky a piece of work would never be en trusted to a single person: on the other hand [???] to turn it over to a committ ee would be to admit openly that an act of [???] was taking place. very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said. and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that [???] would [???] it and set in motion the complex process es of [???] that would be required [???] and then the chosen lie would pass into the perman ent records and become truth. winston did not know why withers had been disgra ced. perhaps it was for corruption or [???]. perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a [???] [???]. perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretic al [???]. or [???] was likeliest of [???] thing had simply happened because purg es and [???] were a necessary part of the mechanics of government. the only real clue lay in the words [???] [???] [???] which [???] that withers was already dead. you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested. sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly re appearance at some public trial where he would [???] hundreds of others by his testimony before vanish ing [???] this time for ever. withers [???] however [???] was already an un person. he did not exist: he had never existed. winston decided that it would not be enough simply to rever se the tendency of big [???] speech. it was better to make it deal with something totally [???] with its original subject. he might turn the speech into the usual [???] of traitors and [???] [???] but that was a little too obvious [???] while to invent a victory at the front [???] or some triumph of [???] in the ninth [???] plan [???] might [???] the records too much. what was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. suddenly there spr ang into his mind [???] ready made as it were [???] the image of a certain comrade [???] [???] who had recently died in battle [???] in heroic circumstances. there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to [???] some humble [???] [???] party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. today he should [???] comrade [???]. it was true that there was no such person as comrade [???] [???] but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence. winston thought for a moment [???] then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began [???] in big [???] familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic [???] and [???] because of a trick of asking questions and then prompt ly answering them [???] lessons do we learn from this fact [???] comrades? the [???] is also one of the [???] principles of [???]' etc. [???] [???] [???] easy to imitate. at the age of three comrade [???] had refused all toys except a drum [???] a [???] gun [???] and a model helicop ter. at [???] year early [???] by a special [???] of the [???] had joined the spies [???] at nine he had been a troop leader. at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after over hearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal [???]. at seventeen he had been a di strict [???] of the junior [???] league. at nineteen he had design ed a [???] which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which [???] at its first trial [???] had killed [???] eurasian prisoners in one burst. at [???] he had perish ed in action. pursued by enemy jet plan es while flying over the indian ocean with important [???] [???] he had weight ed his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicop ter into deep water [???] [???] and [???] end [???] said big brother [???] which it was impossible to contempl ate without feelings of envy. big brother added a few remarks on the purity and [???] of comrade [???] life. he was a tot al [???] and a [???] [???] had no recreations except a daily hour in the [???] [???] and had taken a vow of [???] [???] believ ing marriage and the care of a family to be [???] with a [???] devotion to duty. he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc [???] and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the [???] of spies [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and traitors generally. winston debated with himself whether to award comrade [???] the order of [???] merit: in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary [???] that it would entail. once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. something seemed to tell him with certainty that [???] was busy on the same job as himself. there was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted [???] but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. comrade [???] [???] un imagined an hour ago [???] was now a fact. it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. comrade [???] [???] who had never existed in the present [???] now existed in the past [???] and when once the act of forge ry was forgotten [???] he would exist just as [???] [???] and upon the same evidence [???] as [???] or julius caesar. chapter 5 in the [???] canteen [???] deep underground [???] the lun ch queue jerked slowly forward. the room was already very full and [???] noisy. from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pour ing forth [???] with a sour metal lic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin. on the far side of the room there was a small bar [???] a mere hole in the wall [???] where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.'just the man i was looking [???]' said a voice at [???] back. he turned round. it was his friend syme [???] who worked in the re search department. perhaps' friend' was not exactly the right word. you did not have friends [???] [???] you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose society was pleasant er than that of others. syme was a [???] [???] a specialist in newspeak. indeed [???] he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary. he was a tiny creature [???] small er than winston [???] with dark hair and large [???] [???] eyes [???] at once mourn ful and [???] [???] which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you.'i wanted to ask you whether [???] got any razor [???]' he said.' not one!' said winston with a sort of guilty haste. [???] tried all over the place. they [???] exist any longer.' everyone kept asking you for razor blades. actually he had two unus ed ones which he was [???] up. there had been a fam ine of them for months past. at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops were unable to supply. sometimes it was buttons [???] sometimes it was dar ning wool [???] sometimes it was [???]; at present it was razor blades. you could only get hold of them [???] if at all [???] by [???] more or less [???] on the' free' market. [???] been using the same blade for six [???]' he added [???]. the queue gave another jerk forward. as they halt ed he turned and faced syme again. each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.' did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' said syme.'i was [???]' said winston indifferent ly.'i shall see it on the [???] [???] i suppose.''a very [???] [???]' said syme. his mocking eyes roved over [???] face.'i know [???]' the eyes seemed to say [???]'i see through you. i know very well why you [???] go to see those prisoners hanged.' in an intellectual way [???] syme was venomously orthodox. he would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicop ter raids on enemy villages [???] and trials and confessions of [???] [???] the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love. talking to him was large ly a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him [???] if possible [???] in the [???] of newspeak [???] on which he was [???] and interest ing. winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scru tiny of the large dark eyes.' it was a good [???]' said syme [???].'i think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. i like to see them kick ing. and above all [???] at the end [???] the tongue stick ing right out [???] and [???] quite bright blue. [???] the detail that appeals to me.' [???] [???] please!' yell ed the [???] prole with the lad le. winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. on to each was dumped swift ly the regulation [???] metal [???] of [???] stew [???] a hunk of bread [???] a cube of cheese [???] a mug of milk less victory coffee [???] and one [???] tablet. [???] a table over there [???] under that [???]' said syme. [???] pick up a gin on the way.' the gin was served out to them in handle less china mugs. they thread ed their way across the crowded room and [???] their trays on to the [???] table [???] on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew [???] a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. winston took up his mug of gin [???] paused for an instant to collect his ner ve [???] and [???] the [???] stuff down. when he had wink ed the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. he began swallow ing [???] of the stew [???] which [???] in among its general [???] [???] had cub es of [???] pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their [???]. from the table at [???] left [???] a little behind his back [???] someone was talking rap idly and continuously [???] a harsh [???] almost like the [???] of a duck [???] which pierced the general up roar of the room.'how is the dictionary getting on?' said winston [???] raising his voice to overcome the noise. [???]' said syme. [???] on the [???]. [???] [???]' he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak. he pushed his [???] aside [???] took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other [???] and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting.'the eleventh edition is the [???] [???]' he said. [???] getting the language into its final [???] shape [???] going to have when nobody speaks anything else. when [???] finished with it [???] people like you will have to learn it all over again. you think [???] i dare say [???] that our chief job is invent ing new words. but not a bit of it! [???] destroy ing [???] of them [???] hundreds of them [???] every day. [???] cutting the language down to the bone. the eleventh edition [???] contain a single word that will become [???] before the year [???]' he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of [???] [???] then continued speaking [???] with a sort of [???] passion. his thin dark face had become animated [???] his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy. [???] a beautiful thing [???] the destruction of words. of course the great wast age is in the verbs and [???] [???] but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. it [???] only the [???]; there are also the antonyms. after all [???] what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? a word contains its opposite in itself. take [???] [???] for instance. if you have a word like [???] [???] what need is there for a word like [???]? [???] [???] will do just as [???] [???] because [???] an exact opposite [???] which the other is not. or again [???] if you want a stronger version of [???] [???] what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like [???] [???] and [???] [???] and all the rest of them? [???] [???] cove rs the meaning [???] or [???] [???] if you want something stronger still. of course we use those forms already. but in the final version of newspeak [???] be nothing else. in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six [???] reality [???] only one word. [???] you see the beauty of that [???] winston? it was [???] idea original ly [???] of [???]' he added as an after thought. a sort of vap id eagerness flitted across [???] face at the mention of big brother. nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of [???].' you [???] a real [???] of newspeak [???] [???]' he said almost sadly.' even when you write it [???] still thinking in oldspeak. [???] read some of those pieces that you write in [???] times [???] occasionally. [???] good enough [???] but [???] translations. in your heart [???] prefer to stick to oldspeak [???] with all its vagueness and its useless sha des of meaning. you [???] grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. do you know that newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets small er every year?' winston did know that [???] of course. he smiled [???] sympathetically he hoped [???] not trust ing himself to speak. syme bit off another fragment of the [???] bread [???] che wed it briefly [???] and went on: [???] you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible [???] because there will be no words in which to express it. every concept that can ever be needed [???] will be expressed by exactly one word [???] with its meaning rig idly defined and all its [???] meanings rubb ed out and forgotten. already [???] in the eleventh edition [???] [???] not far from that point. but the process will still be continu ing long after you and i are dead. every year few er and few er words [???] and the range of consciousness always a little small er. even now [???] of course [???] [???] no reason or excuse for committ ing thoughtcrime. [???] merely a question of [???] [???] [???]. but in the end there [???] be any need even for that. the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc is [???]' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction.' has it ever occurred to you [???] winston [???] that by the year [???] [???] at the very latest [???] not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?' [???]' began winston doubtful ly [???] and he stopped. it had been on the tip of his tongue to say' except the [???]' but he check ed himself [???] not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way un orthodox. syme [???] however [???] had divin ed what he was about to say.'the proles are not human [???]' he said careless ly.'by [???] [???] [???] real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared. the whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. [???] [???] [???] [???] milton [???] [???] exist only in newspeak versions [???] not merely changed into something different [???] but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. even the literature of the party will change. even the slogans will change. how could you have a slog an like [???] is slavery [???] when the concept of freedom has been abolished? the whole clim ate of thought will be different. in fact there will be no thought [???] as we understand it now. orthodoxy means not [???] need ing to think. orthodoxy is [???]' one of these days [???] thought winston with sudden deep conviction [???] syme will be vaporized. he is too intelligent. he sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. the party does not like such people. one day he will disapp ear. it is written in his face. winston had finished his bread and cheese. he turned a little side ways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. at the table on his left the man with the str ident voice was still talking [???] away. a young woman who was perhaps his secretary [???] and who was sitting with her back to winston [???] was listening to him and seemed to be eager ly agree ing with everything that he said. from time to time winston caught some such remark as'i think [???] so right [???] i do so agree with you' [???] uttered in a youthful and rather silly [???] voice. but the other voice never stopped for an instant [???] even when the girl was speaking. winston knew the man by sight [???] though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the fiction department. he was a man of about thirty [???] with a [???] throat and a large [???] [???] mouth. his head was thrown back a little [???] and because of the angle at which he was sitting [???] his spectacles caught the light and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes. what was slightly horrible [???] was that from the stream of sound that pour ed out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. just once winston caught a [???] and final [???] of [???] out very rap idly and [???] as it seemed [???] all in one piece [???] like a line of ty pe cast solid. for the rest it was just a noise [???] a [???]. and yet [???] though you could not actually hear what the man was saying [???] you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. he might be denouncing goldstein and demand ing ster ner measures against [???] and [???] [???] he might be [???] against the [???] of the eurasian army [???] he might be praising big brother or the hero es on the [???] [???] made no difference. whatever it was [???] you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy [???] pure ingsoc. as he watched the eyel ess face with the jaw moving rap idly up and down [???] winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dum my. it was not the [???] brain that was speaking [???] it was his [???]. the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words [???] but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness [???] like the [???] of a duck. syme had fallen silent for a moment [???] and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. the voice from the other table [???] rap idly on [???] easily audible in spite of the [???] din.' there is a word in [???]' said syme [???]'i [???] know whether you know it: duckspeak [???] to qu ack like a duck. it is one of those interest ing words that have two contradictory meanings. applied to an [???] [???] it is abuse [???] applied to someone you agree with [???] it is praise.' [???] syme will be vaporized [???] winston thought again. he thought it with a kind of sadness [???] although well knowing that syme despised him and slightly disliked him [???] and was fully capable of denouncing him as a [???] if he saw any reason for doing so. there was something [???] wrong with syme. there was something that he lacked: discretion [???] aloofness [???] a sort of saving stupidity. you could not say that he was un orthodox. he believed in the principles of ingsoc [???] he [???] big brother [???] he rejoiced over victories [???] he hated heretics [???] not merely with [???] but with a sort of restless zeal [???] an [???] of information [???] which the ordinary party member did not approach. yet a faint air of [???] always cl ung to him. he said things that would have been better unsaid [???] he had read too many books [???] he [???] the chestnut tree ca fe [???] haunt of painters and musicians. there was no law [???] not even an un written law [???] against [???] the chestnut tree ca fe [???] yet the place was somehow [???]. the old [???] [???] leaders of the party had been used to gather there before they were finally purg ed. goldstein himself [???] it was said [???] had sometimes been seen there [???] years and decades ago. [???] fate was not difficult to fores ee. and yet it was a fact that if syme grasp ed [???] even for three seconds [???] the nature of his [???] [???] [???] secret opinions [???] he would betray him instantly to the thought police. so would anybody else [???] for that matter: but syme more than most. zeal was not enough. orthodoxy was unconsciousness. syme looked up.'here comes [???]' he said. something in the tone of his voice seemed to add [???]' that bloody fool'. parsons [???] [???] [???] at victory mansions [???] was in fact thread ing his way across the [???] tubby [???] [???] man with fair hair and a [???] face. at [???] he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waist line [???] but his movements were brisk and boyish. his whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large [???] so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls [???] it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts [???] grey shirt [???] and red [???] of the spies. in [???] him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pud gy fore arms. parsons did [???] indeed [???] invariably reve rt to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. he greet ed them both with a cheery [???] [???] [???]' and sat down at the table [???] giving off an intense smell of sweat. beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. his powers of sweating were extraordinary. at the community centre you could always tell when he had been playing [???] by the dampness of the bat handle. syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words [???] and was study ing it with an [???] between his fingers.'look at him working away in the lun ch [???]' said parsons [???] [???] winston. [???] [???] eh? [???] that [???] got there [???] old boy? something a bit too brainy for me [???] i expect. smith [???] old boy [???] [???] tell you why [???] chasing you. [???] that sub you forgot to give me.'' which sub is that?' said winston [???] [???] feeling for money. about a quarter of [???] salary had to be ear marked for voluntary [???] [???] which were so [???] that it was difficult to keep track of them.'for hate week. you [???] [???] fund. [???] treasurer for our block. [???] making an [???] [???] to put on a tremendous show. i tell you [???] it [???] be my fault if old victory mansions [???] have the big gest out fit of flags in the whole street. two dollars you promised me.' winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes [???] which parsons entered in a small note book [???] in the neat hand writing of the [???].'by the way [???] old [???]' he said.'i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his [???] yesterday. i gave him a good [???] for it. in fact i told him [???] take the [???] away if he does it again.''i think he was a little upset at not going to the [???]' said winston.'ah [???] [???] i mean to say [???] shows the right spirit [???] [???] it? [???] little beggars they are [???] both of them [???] but talk about keenness! all they think about is the spies [???] and the war [???] of course. [???] know what that little girl of mine did last [???] [???] when her troop was on a hike out [???] way? she got two other girls to go with her [???] slipped off from the hike [???] and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. they kept on his tail for two hours [???] right through the woods [???] and then [???] when they got into [???] [???] handed him over to the [???]'' what did they do that for?' said winston [???] somewhat taken ab ack. parsons went on triumphant ly:' my k id made sure he was some kind of enemy [???] have been dropped by [???] [???] for instance. but [???] the point [???] old boy. what do you think put her on to him in the first place? she spotted he was wearing a funny kind of [???] [???] never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before. so the chances were he was a foreign er. pretty smart for a [???] of seven [???] eh?'' what happened to the man?' said winston.'ah [???] that i [???] say [???] of course. but i [???] be altogether surprised [???]' parsons made the motion of aim ing a ri fle [???] and clicked his tongue for the [???]. [???]' said syme [???] [???] without looking up from his strip of paper.'of course we [???] afford to take [???]' agreed winston dutifully.' what i mean to say [???] there is a war [???]' said parsons. as though in confirmation of this [???] a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads. however [???] it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time [???] but merely an announce ment from the ministry of plenty. [???]' cried an eager youthful voice.' attention [???] comrades! we have glorious news for you. we have won the battle for production! returns now completed of the out put of all class es of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year. all over oceania this morning there were [???] [???] demonstrations when workers march ed out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the new [???] happy life which his wise leader ship has bestowed upon us. here are some of the completed figures. [???]' the phrase' our new [???] happy life' [???] several times. it had been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty. parsons [???] his attention caught by the trumpet call [???] sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity [???] a sort of edified bore dom. he could not follow the figures [???] but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. he had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of char red tobacco. with the tobacco ration at 100 gramm es a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully [???]. the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter nois es and was listening to the stuff that stream ed out of the telescreen. it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty gramm es a week. and only yesterday [???] he reflected [???] it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty gramm es a week. was it possible that they could swallow that [???] after only [???] hours? yes [???] they swallowed it. parsons swallowed it easily [???] with the stupidity of an anim al. the eyel ess creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically [???] passionate ly [???] with a furious desire to track down [???] denounce [???] and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty gramm es. syme [???] [???] some more complex way [???] involving doublethink [???] syme swallowed it. was he [???] then [???] alone in the possession of a memory? the fabulous [???] continued to pour out of the telescreen. as compared with last year there was more food [???] more clothes [???] more houses [???] more furniture [???] more [???] [???] more fuel [???] more ships [???] more helicopters [???] more books [???] more [???] of everything except disease [???] crime [???] and [???]. year by year and minute by minute [???] everybody and everything was [???] rap idly upwards. as syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoon and was [???] in the [???] gravy that [???] across the table [???] drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. he meditated [???] on the physical texture of life. had it always been like this? had food always tasted like this? he looked round the canteen. a [???] [???] crowded room [???] its walls grimy from the contact of [???] bodies; batter ed metal tables and chairs [???] placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons [???] den ted trays [???] coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy [???] grime in every crack; and a sourish [???] composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metal lic stew and dirty clothes. always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest [???] a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. it was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. in any time that he could accurately remember [???] there had never been quite enough to eat [???] one had never had socks or under clothes that were not full of holes [???] furniture had always been batter ed and [???] [???] rooms [???] [???] tube trains crowded [???] houses falling to pieces [???] bread [???] [???] tea a rarity [???] coffee [???] [???] cigarettes [???] cheap and plentiful except [???] gin. and though [???] of course [???] it grew worse as [???] body aged [???] was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things [???] if [???] heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scar city [???] the interminable winters [???] the stickiness of [???] socks [???] the lifts that never worked [???] the cold water [???] the gritty so ap [???] the cigarettes that came to pieces [???] the food with its strange evil tastes? why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different? he looked round the canteen again. nearly everyone was ugly [???] and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. on the far side of the room [???] sitting at a table alone [???] a small [???] curiously [???] man was drinking a cup of coffee [???] his little eyes dart ing suspicious glances from side to side. how easy it was [???] thought winston [???] if you did not look about you [???] to believe that the physical ty pe set up by the party as an [???] [???] youths and [???] maidens [???] [???] [???] vi tal [???] sun burnt [???] [???] and even [???]. actually [???] so far as he could judge [???] the majority of people in air strip one were small [???] dark [???] and [???]. it was curious how that [???] ty pe [???] in the ministries: little dum py men [???] growing stout very early in life [???] with short legs [???] swift [???] movements [???] and fat [???] faces with very small eyes. it was the ty pe that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the party. the announce ment from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. parsons [???] stirred to vague [???] by the [???] of figures [???] took his pipe out of his mouth.'the ministry of [???] certainly done a good job this [???]' he said with a knowing shake of his head.'by the way [???] smith old boy [???] i suppose you [???] got any razor blades you can let me have?'' not [???]' said winston. [???] been using the same blade for six weeks myself.''ah [???] [???] thought [???] ask you [???] old boy.' [???]' said winston. the [???] voice from the next table [???] temporarily silenced during the [???] announce ment [???] had started up again [???] as loud as ever. for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons [???] with her wis py hair and the dust in the creases of her face. within two years those children would be denouncing her to the thought police. mrs parsons would be vaporized. syme would be vaporized. winston would be vaporized. [???] would be vaporized. parsons [???] on the other hand [???] would never be vaporized. the eyel ess creature with the [???] voice would never be vaporized. the little [???] men who [???] so nimbly through the [???] corridors of ministries they [???] too [???] would never be vaporized. and the girl with dark hair [???] the girl from the fiction [???] would never be vaporized either. it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for survival [???] it was not easy to say. at this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. the girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. it was the girl with dark hair. she was looking at him in a sidelong way [???] but with curious [???]. the instant she caught his eye she looked away again. the sweat started out on [???] back bone. a horrible pang of terror went through him. it was gone almost at once [???] but it left a sort of [???] [???] behind. why was she watching him? why did she keep following him about? unfortunate ly he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived [???] or had come there afterwards. but yesterday [???] at any rate [???] during the two minutes hate [???] she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loud ly enough. his earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the thought police [???] but then it was precise ly the [???] spy who was the greatest danger of all. he did not know how long she had been looking at him [???] but perhaps for as much as five minutes [???] and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control. it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. the smallest thing could give you away. a nervous tic [???] an unconscious look of anxiety [???] a habit of muttering to [???] that carried with it the suggestion of [???] [???] of having something to hide. in any case [???] to wear an improper expression on your face(to look [???] when a victory was announced [???] for example) was itself a punish able offence. there was even a word for it in newspeak: facecrime [???] it was called. the girl had turned her back on him again. perhaps after all she was not really following him about [???] perhaps it was [???] that she had sat so close to him two days running. his cigarette had gone out [???] and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table. he would finish smoking it after work [???] if he could keep the tobacco in it. quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police [???] and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days [???] but a cigarette end must not be wasted. syme had folded up his strip of paper and sto wed it away in his pocket. parsons had begun talking again.' did i ever tell you [???] old [???]' he said [???] [???] round the stem of his pipe [???]' about the time when those two [???] of mine set fire to the old [???] skirt because they saw her wrapping up [???] in a poster of [???]? sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. burned her quite bad ly [???] i believe. little beggars [???] eh? but keen as mustard! [???] a [???] train ing they give them in the spies [???] than in my day [???] even. what [???] [???] the latest thing [???] served them out with? ear trumpets for listening through key holes! my little girl brought one home the other [???] it out on our [???] door [???] and reckon ed she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole. of course [???] only a toy [???] mind you. still [???] gives' em the right idea [???] eh?' at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. it was the signal to return to work. all three men spr ang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts [???] and the remaining tobacco fell out of [???] cigarette. chapter 6 winston was writing in his diary: it was three years ago. it was on a dark evening [???] in a narrow [???] near one of the big rail way stations. she was standing near a door way in the wall [???] under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. she had a young face [???] painted very thick. it was really the paint that appeal ed to me [???] the whiteness of it [???] like a mask [???] and the bright red lips. party women never paint their faces. there was nobody else in the street [???] and no telescreens. she said two dollars. [???]- for the moment it was too difficult to go on. he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them [???] trying to [???] out the vision that kept [???]. he had an almost overwhel ming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice. or to bang his head against the wall [???] to kick over the table [???] and hurl the ink pot through the [???] do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was torment ing him. your worst enemy [???] he reflected [???] was your own nervous system. at any moment the tension inside you was liable to transl ate itself into some visible symp tom. he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; a quite [???] man [???] a party member [???] aged [???] to forty [???] tallish and thin [???] carrying a [???]. they were a few metres apart when the left side of the [???] face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. it happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch [???] a quiver [???] rap id as the [???] of a came ra shut ter [???] but obviously habitual. he remembered thinking at the time: that poor devil is done for. and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. there was no way of guard ing against that [???] so far as he could see. he drew his breath and went on writing: i went with her through the door way and across a backyard into a basement kitchen. there was a bed against the wall [???] and a lamp on the table [???] turned down very low. [???]- his teeth were set on edge. he would have liked to spit. simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine [???] his wife. winston was [???] been married [???] at any rate: probably he still was married [???] so far as he knew his wife was not dead. he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy od our of the basement kitchen [???] an od our compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent [???] but nevertheless alluring [???] because no woman of the party ever used scent [???] or could be imagined as doing so. only the proles used scent. in his mind the smell of it was [???] mixed up with [???]. when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lap se in two years or thereabouts. consort ing with [???] was forbidden [???] of course [???] but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally ner ve yourself to break. it was dangerous [???] but it was not a [???] matter. to be caught with a [???] might mean five years in a [???] camp: not more [???] if you had committed no other offence. and it was easy enough [???] provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. the poorer quarters swar med with women who were ready to sell themselves. some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin [???] which the proles were not supposed to drink. [???] the party was even inclin ed to encourage [???] [???] as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether sup pressed. mere [???] did not matter very much [???] so long as it was [???] and joy less and only involved the women of a [???] and despised class. the [???] crime was [???] between party members. [???] this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purg es invariably confessed [???] was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening. the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from form ing loyalties which it might not be able to control. its real [???] [???] purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. not love so much as [???] was the enemy [???] inside marriage as well as outside it. all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committ ee appointed for the purpose [???] [???] the principle was never clearly [???] was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physical ly attract ed to one another. the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party. sexual inter course was to be looked on as a slightly disgu sting min or ope ration [???] like having an enema. this again was never put into plain words [???] but in an indirect way it was rubb ed into every party member from childhood onwards. there were even [???] such as the junior [???] league [???] which [???] complete [???] for both sex es. all children were to be begotten by artificial [???] [???] [???] it was called in newspeak) and brought up in public [???]. this [???] winston was aware [???] was not meant altogether serious ly [???] but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party. the party was trying to kill the sex instinct [???] or [???] if it could not be killed [???] then to distort it and dirty it. he did not know why this was so [???] but it seemed natural that it should be so. and as far as the women were concerned [???] the [???] efforts were large ly success ful. he thought again of katharine. it must be nine [???] [???] eleven years since they had parted. it was curious how seldom he thought of her. for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. they had only been together for about fifteen months. the party did not permit divorce [???] but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children. katharine was a tall [???] [???] girl [???] very straight [???] with [???] movements. she had a bold [???] [???] face [???] a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. very early in her married life he had [???] perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most [???] she had without exception the most stupid [???] vulgar [???] empty mind that he had ever encountered. she had not a thought in her head that was not a slog an [???] and there was no [???] [???] absolute ly none that she was not capable of swallow ing if the party handed it out to her.'the human [???]' he nick named her in his own mind. yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one [???]. as soon as he touched her she seemed to win ce and stiff en. to embrace her was like embracing a joint ed wooden image. and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously push ing him away with all her strength. the rigidity of her [???] managed to convey that impression. she would lie there with shut eyes [???] neither resist ing nor [???] but submitting. it was [???] [???] [???] and [???] after a while [???] horrible. but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain [???]. but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this. they must [???] she said [???] produce a child if they could. so the performance continued to happen [???] once a week quite regular ly [???] whenever it was not impossible. she even used to remind him of it in the morning [???] as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. she had two names for it. one was' making a baby' [???] and the other was' our duty to the party'( yes [???] she had actually used that phrase). quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. but luckily no child appeared [???] and in the end she agreed to give up trying [???] and soon afterwards they parted. winston sigh ed [???]. he picked up his pen again and wrote: she threw herself down on the bed [???] and at once [???] without any kind of [???] in the most coarse [???] horrible way you can imagine [???] pulled up her skirt. [???]- he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight [???] with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his [???] [???] and in his heart a feeling of defeat and [???] which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of [???] white body [???] frozen for ever by the [???] power of the party. why did it always have to be like this? why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy [???] at intervals of years? but a real love affair was an almost [???] event. the women of the party were all alike. chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty. by careful early condition ing [???] by games and cold water [???] by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league [???] by lectures [???] parades [???] songs [???] slogans [???] and martial music [???] the natural feeling had been driven out of them. his reason told him that there must be exceptions [???] but his heart did not believe it. they were all [???] [???] as the party intended that they should be. and what he wanted [???] more even than to be loved [???] was to break down that wall of virtue [???] even if it were only once in his whole life. the sexual act [???] success fully performed [???] was rebellion. desire was thoughtcrime. even to have awakened katharine [???] if he could have achieved it [???] would have been like a seduction [???] although she was his wife. but the rest of the story had got to be written down. he wrote: i turned up the lamp. when i saw her in the [???]- after the darkness the feeble light of the [???] lamp had seemed very bright. for the first time he could see the woman proper ly. he had taken a step towards her and then halt ed [???] full of lust and terror. he was painful ly conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. if he went away without even doing what he had come here to [???]! it had got to be written down [???] it had got to be confessed. what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old. the paint was plaster ed so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask. there were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open [???] reveal ing nothing except a [???] blackness. she had no teeth at all. he wrote hurried ly [???] in [???] hand writing: when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman [???] fifty years old at least. but i went ahead and did it just the same. he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. he had written it down at last [???] but it made no difference. the [???] had not worked. the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever. chapter 7'if there is [???]' wrote winston [???]' it lies in the proles.' if there was hope [???] it must lie in the proles [???] because only there in those swar ming dis regarded masses [???] 85 per cent of the population of oceania [???] could the force to destroy the party ever be generated. the party could not be overthrown from within. its enemies [???] if it had any enemies [???] had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. even if the [???] brotherhood existed [???] as just possibly it might [???] it was [???] that its members could ever assemb le in larger numbers than twos and threes. rebellion meant a look in the eyes [???] an [???] of the voice [???] at the most [???] an occasion al whispered word. but the proles [???] if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no need to conspire. they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning. surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? and [???]! he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices [???] [???] burst from a [???] a little way ahead. it was a great [???] cry of anger and despair [???] a deep [???] loud [???]' that went hum ming on like the [???] of a bell. his heart had leapt. [???] started! he had thought. a riot! the proles are breaking loose at last! when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowd ing round the stalls of a street market [???] with faces as tragic as though they had been the doom ed passengers on a sinking ship. but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. it appeared that one of the stalls had been sel ling tin [???]. they were wretched [???] [???] things [???] but [???] of any kind were always difficult to get. now the supply had [???] given out. the success ful women [???] [???] and [???] by the rest [???] were trying to make off with their [???] while dozens of others clamour ed round the st all [???] accus ing the [???] of [???] and of having more [???] somewhere in reserve. there was a fresh out burst of yells. two bloated women [???] one of them with her hair coming down [???] had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one [???] hands. for a moment they were both tugging [???] and then the handle came off. winston watched them [???]. and yet [???] just for a moment [???] what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered? he wrote: until they become conscious they will never rebel [???] and until after they have rebel led they cannot become conscious. that [???] he reflected [???] might almost have been a [???] from one of the party text books. the party claim ed [???] of course [???] to have liberated the proles from bondage. before the revolution they had been hideous ly oppressed by the capitalists [???] they had been starved and flogged [???] women had been forced to work in the coal min es( women still did work in the coal min es [???] as a matter of fact) [???] children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. but simultaneously [???] true to the principles of doublethink [???] the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection [???] like animals [???] by the application of a few simple rules. in reality very little was known about the proles. it was not necessary to know much. so long as they continued to work and breed [???] their other [???] were without importance. left to themselves [???] like cattle turned loose upon the plains of [???] [???] they had rever ted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them [???] a sort of ancestral pattern. they were born [???] they grew up in the [???] [???] they went to work at twelve [???] they passed through a brief [???] of beauty and sexual desire [???] they married at twenty [???] they were [???] at thirty [???] they died [???] for the most part [???] at sixty. heavy physical work [???] the care of home and children [???] petty quarrels with neighbours [???] films [???] foot ball [???] beer [???] and above all [???] gambling [???] filled up the [???] of their minds. to keep them in control was not difficult. a few agents of the thought police moved always among them [???] spread ing false rumours and mark ing down and [???] the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to [???] them with the ideology of the party. it was not desir able that the proles should have strong political feelings. all that was required of them was a primitive [???] which could be appeal ed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer [???] or short er rations. and even when they became discontented [???] as they sometimes did [???] their discontent led nowhere [???] because being without general ideas [???] they could only focus it on petty [???] grievances. the larger evils invariably escaped their notice. the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their hom es. even the civil police [???] with them very little. there was a vast amount of criminality in london [???] a whole [???] of thieves [???] band its [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves [???] it was of no importance. in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code. the sexual [???] of the party was not imposed upon them. [???] went [???] [???] divorce was permit ted. for that matter [???] even religious worship would have been permit ted if the proles had shown any sign of need ing or wanting it. they were beneath suspicion. as the party slog an put it:' proles and animals are free.' winston reached down and [???] scratch ed his [???] ulcer. it had begun itching again. the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like. he took out of the drawer a copy of a [???] history text book which he had borrowed from mrs parsons [???] and began copy ing a passage into the diary: in the old days( it ran) [???] before the glorious revolution [???] london was not the beautiful city that we know today. it was a dark [???] dirty [???] miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under. children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale [???] and water. but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them. these rich men were called capitalists. they were fat [???] ugly men with wicked faces [???] like the one in the picture on the opposite page. you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat [???] and a que er [???] shiny hat shaped like a [???] [???] which was called a top hat. this was the uniform of the capitalists [???] and no one else was allowed to wear it. the capitalists owned everything in the world [???] and everyone else was their slave. they owned all the land [???] all the houses [???] all the factories [???] and all the money. if anyone [???] them they could throw them into prison [???] or they could take his job away and starve him to death. when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him [???] and take off his cap and address him as [???]. the chief of all the capitalists was called the king [???] [???]- but he knew the rest of the [???]. there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves [???] the judg es in their er mine robes [???] the pillory [???] the stocks [???] the tread mill [???] the [???] tails [???] the lord [???] banquet [???] and the practice of kissing the [???] toe. there was also something called the jus primae [???] [???] which would probably not be mentioned in a text book for children. it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories. how could you tell how much of it was lies? it might be true that the ave rage human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution. the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones [???] the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and in security [???] but simply its bareness [???] its dinginess [???] its [???]. life [???] if you looked about you [???] bore no re semblance not only to the lies that stream ed out of the telescreens [???] but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve. great ar eas of it [???] even for a party member [???] were [???] and [???] [???] a matter of slogging through dreary jobs [???] fighting for a place on the tube [???] dar ning a [???] sock [???] cadging a [???] tablet [???] saving a cigarette end. the ideal set up by the party was something huge [???] terrible [???] and [???] world of steel and concrete [???] of monstrous machines and terrifying [???] nation of warriors and [???] [???] marching forward in perfect uni ty [???] all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans [???] perpetual ly working [???] fighting [???] triumph ing [???] [???] hundred million people all with the same face. the reality was decay ing [???] dingy cities where under fed people shuff led to and fro in [???] shoes [???] in [???] [???] houses that smelt always of [???] and bad [???]. he seemed to see a vision of london [???] vast and ruinous [???] city of a million [???] [???] and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs parsons [???] a woman with lin ed face and wis py hair [???] fiddling helpless ly with a blocked [???]. he reached down and scratch ed his ank le again. day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with [???] prov ing that people today had more food [???] more clothes [???] better houses [???] better [???] they lived longer [???] worked short er hours [???] were bigger [???] healthier [???] stronger [???] happier [???] more intelligent [???] better educated [???] than the people of fifty years ago. not a word of it could ever be proved or dis proved. the party claim ed [???] for example [???] that today 40 per cent of ad ult proles were liter ate: before the revolution [???] it was said [???] the number had only been 15 per cent. the party claim ed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand [???] whereas before the revolution it had been [???] so it went on. it was like a single equation with two unknowns. it might very well be that literally every word in the history books [???] even the things that one accepted without question [???] was pure fantasy. for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae [???] [???] or any such creature as a capitalist [???] or any such garment as a top hat. everything faded into mist. the past was erased [???] the erasure was forgotten [???] the lie became truth. just once in his life he had [???] the event: that was what [???] [???] [???] evidence of an act of falsification. he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds. in [???] [???] it must have [???] any rate [???] it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted. but the really [???] date was seven or eight years earlier. the story really began in the middle sixties [???] the period of the great purg es in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all. by [???] none of them was left [???] except big brother himself. all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and [???]. goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where [???] and of the others [???] a few had simply disappeared [???] while the majority had been executed after [???] public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. among the last [???] were three men named jones [???] aaronson [???] and [???]. it must have been in [???] that these three had been arrested. as often happened [???] they had vanished for a year or more [???] so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead [???] and then had suddenly been brought forth to [???] themselves in the usual way. they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy( at that date [???] too [???] the enemy was eurasia) [???] [???] of public funds [???] the murder of various trusted party members [???] [???] against the leader ship of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened [???] and acts of [???] causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. after confess ing to these things they had been pardon ed [???] [???] in the party [???] and given posts which were in fact [???] but which sounded important. all three had written long [???] abject articles in'the times' [???] [???] the reasons for their defection and promis ing to make amends. some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree ca fe. he remembered the sort of terrified [???] with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. they were men far older than himself [???] relics of the ancient world [???] almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the party. the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly cl ung to them. he had the feeling [???] though already at that time facts and dat es were growing [???] [???] that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother. but also they were outlaws [???] enemies [???] [???] [???] doom ed with absolute certainty to [???] within a year or two. no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end. they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave. there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. it was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin [???] with clo ves which was the speciality of the ca fe. of the three [???] it was [???] whose appearance had most impress ed winston. [???] had once been a famous [???] [???] whose bru tal [???] had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution. even now [???] at long intervals [???] his [???] were appear ing in the times. they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner [???] and curiously life less and [???]. always they were a [???] of the ancient [???] [???] [???] starving children [???] street battles [???] capitalists in top [???] on the [???] the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless [???] hopeless effort to get back into the past. he was a monstrous man [???] with a mane of greasy grey hair [???] his face [???] and sea med [???] with thick [???] lips. at one time he must have been [???] strong; now his great body was sagging [???] [???] [???] bulging [???] falling away in every direction. he seemed to be breaking up before [???] eyes [???] like a mountain crumbling. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the ca fe at such a time. the place was almost empty. a tinny music was trick ling from the telescreens. the three men sat in their corner almost motion less [???] never speaking. un commanded [???] the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. there was a chessboard on the table beside them [???] with the pieces set out but no game started. and then [???] for perhaps half a minute in all [???] something happened to the telescreens. the tune that they were playing changed [???] and the tone of the music changed too. there came into [???] it was something hard to describe. it was a peculiar [???] crack ed [???] braying [???] jeering note: in his mind winston called it a yellow note. and then a voice from the telescreen was singing: under the spread ing chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me: there lie they [???] and here lie we under the spread ing chestnut tree. the three men never stirred. but when winston glanced again at [???] ruinous face [???] he saw that his eyes were full of tears. and for the first time he noticed [???] with a kind of inward shud der [???] and yet not knowing at what he [???] [???] that both aaronson and [???] had broken noses. a little later all three were [???]. it appeared that they had engaged in fresh [???] from the very moment of their release. at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again [???] with a whole string of new ones. they were executed [???] and their fate was record ed in the party histories [???] a warning to posterity. about five years after this [???] in [???] [???] winston was un rolling a wad of [???] which had just flopped out of the [???] tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. the instant he had [???] it out he saw its [???]. it was a [???] torn out of'the times' of about ten years [???] top half of the page [???] so that it included the [???] it contained a photograph of the [???] at some party function in new york. prominent in the middle of the group were jones [???] aaronson [???] and [???]. there was no mis taking them [???] in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom. the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil. they had flown from a secret airfield in [???] to a [???] somewhere in [???] [???] and had confer red with members of the eurasian general staff [???] to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. the date had stuck in [???] memory because it chanced to be mid summer day; but the whole story must be on record in count less other places as well. there was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies. of course [???] this was not in itself a discovery. even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purg es had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. but this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past [???] like a [???] bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a [???] theory. it was enough to blow the party to [???] [???] if in some way it could have been publish ed to the world and its [???] made known. he had gone straight on working. as soon as he saw what the photograph was [???] and what it meant [???] he had covered it up with another sheet of paper. luckily [???] when he unrolled it [???] it had been [???] from the point of view of the telescreen. he took his [???] pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. to keep your face expression less was not difficult [???] and even your breathing could be control led [???] with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart [???] and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by [???] torment ed all the while by the fear that some [???] sudden draught blowing across his desk [???] for [???] betray him. then [???] without uncover ing it again [???] he dropped the photograph into the memory hole [???] along with some other waste papers. within another minute [???] perhaps [???] it would have [???] into ashes. that was [???] years ago. today [???] probably [???] he would have kept that photograph. it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now [???] when the photograph itself [???] as well as the event it record ed [???] was only memory. was the [???] hold upon the past less strong [???] he wondered [???] because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed? but today [???] supposing that it could be somehow [???] from its ashes [???] the photograph might not even be evidence. already [???] at the time when he made his discovery [???] oceania was no longer at war with eurasia [???] and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. since then there had been other [???] [???] three [???] he could not remember how many. very likely the confessions had been re written and re written until the original facts and dat es no longer had the smallest [???]. the past not only changed [???] but changed continuously. what most afflict ed him with the sense of night mare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious [???] but the ultimate motive was mysterious. he took up his pen again and wrote: i understand how: i do not understand why. he wondered [???] as he had many times wondered before [???] whether he himself was a lunatic. perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today [???] to believe that the past is [???]. he might be alone in holding that belief [???] and if alone [???] then a lunatic. but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong. he picked up the [???] history book and looked at the [???] of big brother which formed its [???]. the [???] eyes gazed into his own. it was as though some huge force were press ing down upon [???] that [???] inside your skull [???] batter ing against your brain [???] frightening you out of your beliefs [???] persuading you [???] almost [???] to deny the evidence of your senses. in the end the party would announce that two and two made five [???] and you would have to believe it. it was [???] that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. not merely the validity of experience [???] but the very existence of external reality [???] was [???] denied by their philosophy. the heresy of heresies was common sense. and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise [???] but that they might be right. for [???] after all [???] how do we know that two and two make four? or that the force of gravity works? or that the past is [???]? if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind [???] and if the mind itself is [???] what then? but no! his courage seemed suddenly to stiff en of its own accord. the face of [???] [???] not called up by any obvious association [???] had floated into his mind. he knew [???] with more certainty than before [???] that [???] was on his side. he was writing the diary for [???] [???]: it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read [???] but which was address ed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact. the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. it was their final [???] most essential command. his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power array ed against him [???] the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate [???] the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand [???] much less answer. and yet he was in the right! they were wrong and he was right. the obvious [???] the silly [???] and the true had got to be defend ed. [???] are true [???] hold on to that! the solid world exists [???] its laws do not change. stones are hard [???] water is wet [???] objects [???] fall towards the [???] centre. with the feeling that he was speaking to [???] [???] and also that he was setting forth an important [???] [???] he wrote: freedom is the freedom to say that two pl us two make four. if that is granted [???] all else follows. chapter 8 from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting [???] coffee [???] not victory [???] floating out into the street. winston paused [???]. for perhaps two seconds he was back in the [???] world of his childhood. then a door banged [???] seeming to cut off the smell as abrupt ly as though it had been a sound. he had walked several [???] over pavements [???] and his [???] ulcer was [???]. this was the second time in three weeks that he had mis sed an evening at the community centre: a rash act [???] since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the centre was carefully check ed. in principle a party member had no spare time [???] and was never alone except in bed. it was assumed that when he was not working [???] eating [???] or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of commun al recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude [???] even to go for a walk by yourself [???] was always slightly dangerous. there was a word for it in newspeak: own life [???] it was called [???] meaning individualism and [???]. but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him. the sky was a warm er blue than he had seen it that year [???] and suddenly the long [???] noisy evening at the centre [???] the bor ing [???] exhaust ing games [???] the lectures [???] the creaking [???] oil ed by gin [???] had seemed intolerable. on impulse he had turned away from the [???] and wandered off into the [???] of london [???] first south [???] then east [???] then north again [???] losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going.'if there is [???]' he had written in the diary [???]' it lies in the proles.' the words kept coming back to him [???] statement of a mystical truth and a [???] absurdity. he was somewhere in the vague [???] [???] slums to the north and east of what had once been saint [???] station. he was walking up a cobb led street of little [???] houses with batter ed door ways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of rat holes. there were [???] of filthy water here and there among the cobb les. in and out of the dark door ways [???] and down narrow [???] that branch ed off on either side [???] people swar med in astonish ing [???] in full bloom [???] with [???] [???] mouths [???] and youths who cha sed the girls [???] and [???] [???] women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years' time [???] and old bent creatures shuff ling along on s played feet [???] and ragged bare footed children who played in the [???] and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and board ed up. most of the people paid no attention to winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity. two monstrous women with [???] fore arms folded across their aprons were talking outside a door way. winston caught scraps of conversation as he approach ed. [???] [???] i says to' er [???] [???] all very [???] [???] i says. [???] if [???] of been in my place [???] of done the same as what i done. [???] easy to [???] [???] i says [???] [???] you [???] got the same problems as what i [???]' [???]' said the other [???] [???] jest it. [???] jest where it is.' the str ident voices stopped abrupt ly. the women studied him in host ile silence as he went past. but it was not hostility [???] exactly; merely a kind of wariness [???] a momentary stiffening [???] as at the passing of some un familiar anim al. the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this. indeed [???] it was unwise to be seen in such places [???] unless you had definite business there. the patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them.' may i see your papers [???] comrade? what are you doing here? what time did you leave work? is this your usual way [???] so on and so forth. not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about it. suddenly the whole street was in commotion. there were yells of warning from all sides. people were shoot ing into the door ways like rab bits. a young woman leapt out of a door way a little ahead of winston [???] [???] up a tiny child playing in a puddle [???] whipped her apron round it [???] and leapt back again [???] all in one movement. at the same instant a man in a [???] black suit [???] who had [???] from a side alley [???] ran towards winston [???] pointing [???] to the sky. [???]' he yell ed.'look out [???] [???]! bang [???]! lay down quick!'' steamer' was a nick name which [???] for some reason [???] the proles applied to rocket bombs. winston prompt ly flung himself on his face. the proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. they seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming [???] although the rockets supposedly travel led faster than sound. winston clasped his fore arms above his head. there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a sho wer of light objects patter ed on to his back. when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window. he walked on. the bomb had [???] a group of houses 200 metres up the street. a black plume of smoke hung in the sky [???] and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already form ing around the ruins. there was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him [???] and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. when he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. apart from the bloody stump [???] the hand was so completely whitened as to resem ble a plaster cast. he kick ed the thing into the gutter [???] and then [???] to avoid the crowd [???] turned down a [???] to the right. within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected [???] and the sor did swar ming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. it was nearly twenty hours [???] and the [???] which the proles [???] [???] [???] they called them) were choked with customers. from their grimy swing doors [???] endless ly opening and shutting [???] there came forth a smell of ur ine [???] saw dust [???] and sour beer. in an angle formed by a project ing [???] three men were standing very close together [???] the middle one of them holding a [???] newspap er which the other two were study ing over his shoulder. even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces [???] winston could see [???] in every line of their bodies. it was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. he was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent [???]. for a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows. [???] you bleeding well listen to what i say? i tell you no number ending in seven [???] won for over fourteen months!'' yes [???] it' as [???] then!''no [???] it' as not! back'ome i got the'ole lot of' em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper. i takes' em down [???] as the clock. an' i tell you [???] no number ending in [???]'' yes [???] a seven' as won! i could pretty near tell you the bleeding number. four oh seven [???] it ended in. it were in [???] week in [???]' [???] your grand mother! i got it all down in black and white. an' i tell you [???] no [???]'' oh [???] pack it in!' said the third man. they were talking about the [???]. winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres. they were still [???] [???] with vivid [???] passionate faces. the [???] [???] with its week ly [???] of enormous priz es [???] was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the [???] was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. it was their delight [???] their folly [???] their [???] [???] their intellectual [???]. where the [???] was concerned [???] even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of [???] calculations and [???] feats of memory. there was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by sel ling systems [???] [???] [???] and lucky [???]. winston had nothing to do with the running of the [???] [???] which was managed by the ministry of plenty [???] but he was aware( indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the priz es were large ly imaginary. only small sums were actually paid out [???] the winners of the big priz es being [???] persons. in the absence of any real inter communication between one part of oceania and another [???] this was not difficult to arrange. but if there was hope [???] it lay in the proles. you had to cling on to that. when you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith. the street into which he had turned ran down hill. he had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before [???] and that there was a main thorough fare not far away. from somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sun ken alley where a few [???] were sel ling [???] [???]. at this moment winston remembered where he was. the alley led out into the main street [???] and down the next turning [???] not five minutes away [???] was the [???] where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. and in a small [???] shop not far away he had bought his [???] and his bottle of ink. he paused for a moment at the top of the steps. on the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frost ed over but in reality were merely coat ed with dust. a very old man [???] bent but active [???] with white [???] that [???] forward like those of a prawn [???] pushed open the swing door and went in. as winston stood watching [???] it occurred to him that the old man [???] who must be eighty at the least [???] had already been [???] when the revolution happened. he and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the revolution. the older generation had most ly been wiped out in the great purg es of the fifties and sixties [???] and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual sur render. if there was any one still alive who could give you a truth ful account of conditions in the early part of the century [???] it could only be a prole. suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into [???] mind [???] and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. he would go into the pub [???] he would scra pe acquaintance with that old man and question him. he would say to him:' tell me about your life when you were a boy. what was it like in those days? were things better than they are now [???] or were they worse?' hurried ly [???] lest he should have time to become frightened [???] he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. it was madness of course. as usual [???] there was no definite rule against talking to proles and [???] their pubs [???] but it was far too unusual an action to pass un noticed. if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness [???] but it was not likely that they would believe him. he pushed open the door [???] and a hideous chee sy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. as he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume. behind his back he could feel everyone eye ing his blue overalls. a game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds. the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar [???] having some kind of [???] with the barman [???] a large [???] stout [???] [???] young man with enormous fore arms. a knot of others [???] standing round with glasses in their hands [???] were watching the scene.'i ar st you civil enough [???] [???] i?' said the old man [???] straightening his shoulders [???].' you telling me you [???] got a pint mug in the'ole bleeding [???]''and what in [???] name is a pint?' said the barman [???] leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter. [???] at' im! calls [???] a barman and [???] know what a pint is! why [???] a [???] the'alf of a quart [???] and [???] four quarts to the gall on.' ave to teach you the a [???] b [???] c next.'' never heard of [???]' said the barman shortly. [???] and half [???] all we serve. [???] the glasses on the shelf in front of you.''i likes a [???]' persisted the old man.' you could'a draw ed me off a pint easy enough. we [???]' ave these bleeding litres when i was a young man.'' when you were a young man we were all living in the [???]' said the barman [???] with a glance at the other customers. there was a shout of laughter [???] and the [???] caused by [???] ent ry seemed to disapp ear. the old [???] [???] face had [???] pink. he turned away [???] muttering to himself [???] and [???] into winston. winston caught him gently by the arm.' may i offer you a drink?' he said. [???] a [???]' said the other [???] straightening his shoulders again. he appeared not to have noticed [???] blue overalls. [???]' he added [???] to the barman.' pint of [???]' the barman swished two [???] of [???] beer into thick glasses which he had [???] in a buck et under the counter. beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. the proles were supposed not to drink gin [???] though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. the game of darts was in full swing again [???] and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about [???] tickets. [???] presence was forgotten for a moment. there was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard. it was horribly dangerous [???] but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room [???] a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in. [???] could'a draw ed me off a [???]' [???] the old man as he settled down behind a glass.'a'alf lit re [???] enough. it [???] satisfy. and a'ole [???] too much. it starts my bl adder running. let alone the price.'' you must have seen great changes since you were a young [???]' said winston [???]. the old [???] pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar [???] and from the bar to the door of the gents [???] as though it were in the [???] that he expected the changes to have occurred.'the beer was [???]' he said finally.'and cheap er! when i was a young man [???] mild [???] we used to call [???] four pence a pint. that was before the war [???] of course.'' which war was that?' said winston. [???] all [???]' said the old man vaguely. he took up his glass [???] and his shoulders straightened again. [???] wishing you the very best of [???]' in his lean throat the [???] [???] apple made a surprisingly rap id [???] movement [???] and the beer vanished. winston went to the bar and came back with two more [???]. the old man appeared to have forgotten his [???] against drinking a full lit re.' you are very much older than i [???]' said winston.' you must have been a grown man before i was born. you can remember what it was like in the old days [???] before the revolution. people of my age [???] really know anything about those times. we can only read about them in books [???] and what it says in the books may not be true. i should like your opinion on that. the history books say that life before the revolution was completely different from what it is now. there was the most terrible oppression [???] injustice [???] poverty worse than anything we can imagine. here in london [???] the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. half of them [???] even boots on their feet. they worked twelve hours a day [???] they left school at nine [???] they slept ten in a room. and at the same time there were a very few people [???] only a few [???] capitalists [???] they were [???] were rich and powerful. they owned everything that there was to own. they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants [???] they rode about in [???] and [???] carriages [???] they drank [???] [???] they wore top [???]' the old man brightened suddenly.' top [???]' he said. [???] you should mention' em. the same thing come into my'ead only yesterday [???] i dono why. i was jest thinking [???] i [???] seen a top' at in years. g orn right out [???] they' ave. the last time i wore one was at my [???] funeral. and that [???] [???] i [???] give you the date [???] but it [???] been fifty years ago. of course it was only'ired for the occasion [???] you understand.'' it [???] very important about the top [???]' said winston patiently.'the point is [???] these [???] and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on [???] the lords of the earth. everything existed for their benefit. [???] ordinary people [???] the [???] their slaves. they could do what they liked with you. they could ship you off to [???] like cattle. they could sleep with your daughters if they chose. they could order you to be flogged with something called a [???] tails. you had to take your cap off when you passed them. every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys [???]' the old man brightened again. [???]' he said.'now [???] a word i [???] [???] since ever so long. lackeys! that [???] takes me back [???] that does. i [???] [???] [???] years [???] used to sometimes go to [???] park of a sunday afternoon to' ear the blokes making speeches. salvation army [???] roman [???] [???] jews [???] [???] sorts there was. and there was one [???] [???] i [???] give you' is name [???] but a real powerful speaker'e was.'e [???]'alf give it' em!

[???]' he said.' they liked you to touch your cap to' em. it showed respect [???] like. i [???] agree with it [???] myself [???] but i done it often enough. had to [???] as you might say.''and was it [???] only [???] what [???] read in history [???] it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the [???]'' one of' em pushed me [???]' said the old man.'i re collect it as if it was yesterday. it was boat race [???] row dy they used to get on boat race [???] i bumps into a young blo ke on [???] avenue. quite a gent [???]'e [???] shirt [???] top' at [???] black over coat.'e was kind of [???] across the pavement [???] and i bumps into' im [???].'e says [???] [???] [???] you look where [???] going?

[???] just as [???]' said the other [???]' because i [???] suppose i could have satisfied you.' he made an apologetic gesture with his [???] hand.' you see how it is; an empty shop [???] you might say. between you and me [???] the antique [???] just about finished. no demand any longer [???] and no stock either. furniture [???] china [???] glass [???] all been broken up by degrees. and of course the metal [???] most ly been melted down. i [???] seen a brass candles tick in years.' the tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full [???] but there was almost nothing in it of the slight est value. the floor space was very [???] [???] because all round the walls were [???] [???] dusty [???]. in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts [???] [???] [???] [???] pen knives with broken blades [???] [???] watches that did not even pretend to be in going order [???] and other [???] rubbish. only on a small table in the corner was there a lit ter of odds and [???] [???] [???] ag ate brooches [???] and the [???] looked as though they might include something interest ing. as winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round [???] smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight [???] and he picked it up. it was a heavy lump of glass [???] curved on one side [???] flat on the other [???] making almost a [???]. there was a peculiar softness [???] as of rainwater [???] in both the colour and the texture of the glass. at the heart of it [???] magnified by the curved surface [???] there was a strange [???] pink [???] [???] object that recalled a rose or a sea [???].' what is it?' said winston [???] [???]. [???] cor al [???] that [???]' said the old man.' it must have come from the indian ocean. they used to kind of emb ed it in the glass. that [???] made less than a hundred years ago. more [???] by the look of it.' [???] a beautiful [???]' said winston.' it is a beautiful [???]' said the other [???].' but [???] not many [???] say so [???]' he cough ed.'now [???] if it so happened that you wanted to buy it [???] [???] cost you four dollars. i can remember when a thing like that would have fetch ed eight pounds [???] and eight pounds [???] [???] i [???] work it out [???] but it was a lot of money. but who cares about [???] antiques [???] the few [???] left?' winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the covet ed thing into his pocket. what appeal ed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one. the soft [???] rain watery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. the thing was doub ly attractive because of its apparent uselessness [???] though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight. it was very heavy in his pocket [???] but fortunate ly it did not make much of a bul ge. it was a que er thing [???] even a compromising thing [???] for a party member to have in his possession. anything old [???] and for that matter anything beautiful [???] was always vaguely suspect. the old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two. [???] another room upstairs that you might care to take a look [???]' he said. [???] not much in it. just a few pieces. [???] do with a light if [???] going upstairs.' he lit another lamp [???] and [???] with bow ed back [???] led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage [???] into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobb led yard and a forest of [???]. winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in. there was a strip of carpet on the floor [???] a picture or two on the walls [???] and a deep [???] [???] [???] drawn up to the fire place. an [???] glass clock with a [???] face was tick ing away on the [???]. under the window [???] and occupying nearly a quarter of the room [???] was an enormous bed with the [???] still on it.'we lived here till my wife [???]' said the old man half apologetically. [???] sel ling the furniture off by little and little. now [???] a beautiful [???] bed [???] or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it. but i dare say [???] find it a little bit [???]' he was holding the lamp high up [???] so as to [???] the whole room [???] and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. the thought flitted through [???] mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week [???] if he dared to take the risk. it was a wild [???] impossible notion [???] to be abandon ed as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of [???] [???] a sort of ancestral memory. it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this [???] in an [???] beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a [???] on the hob; utterly alone [???] utterly secure [???] with nobody watching you [???] no voice pursuing you [???] no sound except the singing of the [???] and the friendly tick ing of the clock. [???] no telescreen!' he could not help murmur ing. [???]' said the old man [???]'i never had one of those things. too expensive. and i never seemed to feel the need of it [???] somehow. now [???] a nice gate leg table in the corner there. though of course [???] have to put new [???] on it if you wanted to use the [???]' there was a small bookcase in the other corner [???] and winston had already [???] towards it. it contained nothing but rubbish. the [???] and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else. it was very unlike ly that there existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book print ed earlier than 1960. the old man [???] still carrying the lamp [???] was standing in front of a picture in a rose wood frame which hung on the other side of the fire place [???] opposite the bed.'now [???] if you happen to be interested in old prints at [???]' he began delicate ly. winston came across to examine the picture. it was a steel [???] of an oval building with [???] windows [???] and a small tower in front. there was a rail ing running round the building [???] and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue. winston gazed at it for some moments. it seemed vaguely familiar [???] though he did not remember the statue.'the [???] fixed to the [???]' said the old man [???]' but i could uns crew it for you [???] i dare say.''i know that [???]' said winston finally. [???] a ruin now. [???] in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice.' [???] right. outside the law courts. it was bomb ed [???] [???] many years ago. it was a church at one time [???] st clement danes [???] its name was.' he smiled apologetically [???] as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous [???] and added: [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???]' [???] that?' said winston. [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] that was a rhyme we had when i was a little boy. how it goes on i [???] remember [???] but i do know it ended up [???] [???] comes a candle to light you to bed [???] here comes a chopper to chop off your head. [???] it was a kind of a dance. they held out their arms for you to pass under [???] and when they came to [???] comes a chopper to chop off your head [???] they brought their arms down and caught you. it was just names of church es. all the london church es were in [???] the principal ones [???] that is.' winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belong ed. it was always difficult to determine the age of a london building. anything large and impressive [???] if it was reasonably new in appearance [???] was [???] claim ed as having been built since the revolution [???] while anything that was obviously of earlier date was [???] to some dim period called the middle ages. the [???] of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. one could not learn history from [???] any more than one could learn it from books. statues [???] [???] [???] memorial stones [???] the names of [???] that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered.'i never knew it had been a [???]' he said. [???] a lot of them left [???] [???]' said the old man [???]' though [???] been put to other uses. now [???] how did that rhyme go? ah! [???] got it! [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] you owe me three farthings [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] there [???] now [???] [???] as far as i can get. a farthing [???] that was a small copper coin [???] looked something like a cent.''where was st [???]' said winston.' st [???]? [???] still standing. [???] in victory square [???] alongside the picture gallery. a building with a kind of a [???] por ch and pillars in front [???] and a big flight of steps.' winston knew the place well. it was a museum used for [???] displays of various [???] models of rocket bombs and floating fortress es [???] waxwork tableaux [???] enemy [???] [???] and the like.' st [???] it used to be [???]' [???] the old man [???]' though i [???] re collect any fields anywhere in those parts.' winston did not buy the picture. it would have been an even more [???] possession than the glass paperweight [???] and impossible to carry home [???] unless it were taken out of its frame. but he lingered for some minutes more [???] talking to the old man [???] whose name [???] he discovered [???] was not [???] one might have gather ed from the [???] over the [???] charrington. mr charrington [???] it seemed [???] was a widow er aged [???] and had inhabit ed this shop for thirty years. throughout that time he had been intend ing to alter the name over the window [???] but had never quite got to the point of doing it. all the while that they were talking the [???] rhyme kept running through [???] head. [???] and le mons say the bells of st [???] [???] you owe me three farthings [???] say the bells of st [???]! it was curious [???] but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells [???] the bells of a lost london that still existed somewhere or other [???] disguised and forgotten. from one ghostly steep le after another he seemed to hear them [???] forth. yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ring ing. he got away from mr charrington and went down the stairs alone [???] so as not to let the old man see him [???] the street before stepping out of the door. he had already made up his mind that after a suit able [???] month [???] [???] would take the risk of visit ing the shop again. it was perhaps not more dangerous than [???] an evening at the centre. the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place [???] after buy ing the diary and without knowing whether the [???] of the shop could be trusted. [???]! yes [???] he thought again [???] he would come back. he would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. he would buy the [???] of st clement danes [???] take it out of its frame [???] and carry it home concealed under the jack et of his overalls. he would drag the rest of that po em out of mr [???] memory. even the lunatic project of rent ing the room upstairs flash ed momentarily through his mind again. for perhaps five seconds [???] made him careless [???] and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a [???] glance through the window. he had even started hum ming to an [???] tune [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] you owe me three farthings [???] say [???]- suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement [???] not ten metres away. it was the girl from the fiction department [???] the girl with dark hair. the light was fail ing [???] but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. she looked him straight in the face [???] then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him. for a few seconds winston was too [???] to move. then he turned to the right and walked heavily away [???] not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. at any rate [???] one question was settled. there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spy ing on him. she must have followed him here [???] because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure back street [???] [???] distant from any quarter where party members lived. it was too great a [???]. whether she was really an agent of the thought police [???] or simply an [???] spy [???] by [???] [???] hardly mattered. it was enough that she was watching him. probably she had seen him go into the pub as well. it was an effort to walk. the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step [???] and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away. the worst thing was the pain in his belly. for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. but there would be no public [???] in a quarter like this. then the spasm passed [???] leaving a dull ache behind. the street was a blind alley. winston halt ed [???] stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do [???] then turned round and began to ret race his steps. as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place [???] and then smash her skull in with a [???]. the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. but he abandon ed the idea immediately [???] because even the thought of making any physical effort was [???]. he could not run [???] he could not strike a blow. besides [???] she was young and lusty and would defend herself. he thought also of hurry ing to the community centre and staying there till the place closed [???] so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. but that too was impossible. a deadly [???] had taken hold of him. all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet. it was after [???] hours when he got back to the flat. the lights would be [???] off at the main at [???] thirty. he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a [???] of victory gin. then he went to the table in the al cove [???] sat down [???] and took the diary out of the drawer. but he did not open it at once. from the telescreen a brassy female voice was [???] a [???] song. he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book [???] trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness. it was at night that they came for you [???] always at night. the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. undoubted ly some people did so. many of the [???] were actually [???]. but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where fire arms [???] or any quick and certain poison [???] were completely [???]. he thought with a kind of astonish ment of the [???] uselessness of pain and fear [???] the treachery of the human body which always freezes into [???] at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed. he might have silenced the [???] girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precise ly because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. it struck him that in moments of [???] one is never fighting against an external enemy [???] but always against [???] own body. even now [???] in spite of the gin [???] the dull ache in his belly made [???] thought impossible. and it is the same [???] he perceived [???] in all seeming ly heroic or tragic [???]. on the battlefield [???] in the torture chamber [???] on a sinking ship [???] the issu es that you are fighting for are always forgotten [???] because the body swells up until it fills the universe [???] and even when you are not [???] by fright or screaming with pain [???] life is a [???] struggle against hunger or cold or [???] [???] against a sour stomach or an ach ing tooth. he opened the diary. it was important to write something down. the woman on the telescreen had started a new song. her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged [???] of glass. he tried to think of [???] [???] for whom [???] or to whom [???] the diary was written [???] but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away. it would not matter if they killed you at once. to be killed was what you expected. but before death( nobody spoke of such things [???] yet everybody knew of them) there was the rout ine of confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy [???] the crack of broken bones [???] the smash ed teeth and bloody clots of hair. why did you have to endure it [???] since the end was always the same? why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? nobody ever escaped detection [???] and nobody ever failed to confess. when once you had [???] to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. why then did that horror [???] which altered nothing [???] have to lie [???] in future time? he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of [???].'we shall meet in the place where there is no [???]' [???] had said to him. he knew what it meant [???] or thought he knew. the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future [???] which one would never see [???] but which [???] by fore knowledge [???] one could mystically share in. but with the voice from the telescreen [???] at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further. he put a cigarette in his mouth. half the tobacco prompt ly fell out on to his tongue [???] a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. the face of big brother sw am into his mind [???] [???] that of [???]. just as he had done a few days earlier [???] he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. the face gazed up at him [???] heavy [???] calm [???] protect ing: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark [???]? like a leaden knell the words came back at him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength part two chapter 1 it was the middle of the morning [???] and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory. a solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long [???] [???] corrid or. it was the girl with dark hair. four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the [???]. as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling [???] not notice able at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. probably she had crush ed her hand while swing ing round one of the big [???] on which the plots of novels were [???] in'. it was a common accident in the fiction department. they were perhaps four metres apart when the girl s tumbled and fell almost flat on her face. a sharp cry of pain was wr ung out of her. she must have fallen right on the injur ed arm. winston stopped short. the girl had risen to her knees. her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out red der than ever. her eyes were fixed on his [???] with an appeal ing expression that looked more like fear than pain. a curious emotion stirred in [???] heart. in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him [???] also [???] was a human creature [???] in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. already he had instinctively started forward to help her. in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm [???] it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body. [???] hurt?' he said. [???] nothing. my arm. [???] be all right in a second.' she spoke as though her heart were [???]. she had certainly turned very pale.' you [???] broken anything?''no [???] [???] all right. it hurt for a moment [???] [???] all.' she held out her free hand to him [???] and he helped her up. she had regained some of her colour [???] and appeared very much better. [???] [???]' she repeated shortly.'i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. thanks [???] comrade!' and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going [???] as brisk ly as though it had really been nothing. the whole inc ident could not have taken as much as half a minute. not to let [???] feelings appear in [???] face was a habit that had acquired the stat us of an instinct [???] and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise [???] for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. there was no question that she had done it intentionally. it was something small and flat. as he passed through the lavatory door he [???] it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. it was a scrap of paper folded into a square. while he stood at the urinal he managed [???] with a little more finger ing [???] to get it unfold ed. obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it. for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the [???] and read it at once. but that would be shock ing folly [???] as he well knew. there was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously. he went back to his cubicle [???] sat down [???] threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk [???] put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him.' five [???]' he told himself [???]' five minutes at the very least!' his heart [???] in his breast with frightening loudness. fortunate ly the piece of work he was engaged on was mere rout ine [???] the rectification of a long list of figures [???] not need ing close attention. whatever was written on the paper [???] it must have some kind of political meaning. so far as he could see there were two [???]. one [???] much the more likely [???] was that the girl was an agent of the thought police [???] just as he had feared. he did not know why the thought police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion [???] but perhaps they had their reasons. the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat [???] a summons [???] an order to commit suicide [???] a trap of some description. but there was another [???] wilder possibility that kept raising its head [???] though he tried vain ly to sup press it. this was [???] that the message did not come from the thought police at all [???] but from some kind of underground organization. perhaps the brotherhood existed after all! perhaps the girl was part of it! no doubt the idea was absurd [???] but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. it was not till a couple of minutes later that the other [???] more probable explanation had occurred to him. and even now [???] though his intellect told him that the message probably meant [???] [???] that was not what he believed [???] and the unreasonable hope persisted [???] and his heart banged [???] and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite. he rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the [???] tube. eight minutes had gone by. he [???] his spectacles on his nose [???] sigh ed [???] and drew the next bat ch of work towards him [???] with the scrap of paper on top of it. he [???] it out. on it was written [???] in a large un formed hand writing: i love you. for several seconds he was too [???] even to throw the [???] thing into the memory hole. when he did so [???] although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest [???] he could not resist reading it once again [???] just to make sure that the words were really there. for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. what was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of nigg ling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. he felt as though a fire were burning in his belly. lun ch in the hot [???] crowded [???] [???] canteen was torment. he had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lun ch hour [???] but as bad luck would have it the [???] parsons flopped down beside him [???] the tang of his sweat almost defeat ing the tinny smell of stew [???] and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week. he was particularly [???] about a [???] model of big [???] head [???] two metres wide [???] which was being made for the occasion by his [???] troop of spies. the [???] thing was that in the rack et of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying [???] and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. just once he caught a glimpse of the girl [???] at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room. she appeared not to have seen him [???] and he did not look in that direction again. the afternoon was more bear able. immediately after lun ch there arrived a delicate [???] difficult piece of work which would take several hours and [???] putting everything else aside. it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago [???] in such a way as to cast dis credit on a prominent member of the inner party [???] who was now under a cloud. this was the kind of thing that winston was good at [???] and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. then the memory of her face came back [???] and with it a raging [???] intolerable desire to be alone. until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new develop ment out. tonight was one of his nights at the community centre. he wolf ed another taste less meal in the canteen [???] hurried off to the centre [???] took part in the solemn foolery of a [???] group' [???] played two games of table tennis [???] swallowed several glasses of gin [???] and sat for half an hour through a lecture [???]' ingsoc in relation to chess'. his soul [???] with bore dom [???] but for once he had had no impulse to [???] his evening at the centre. at the sight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive had wel led up in him [???] and the taking of min or risks suddenly seemed stupid. it was not till [???] hours [???] when he was home and in [???] the darkness [???] where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept [???] he was able to think continuously. it was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. he did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. he knew that it was not so [???] because of her [???] agitation when she handed him the note. obviously she had been frightened out of her wits [???] as well she might be. nor did the idea of refus ing her advances even cross his mind. only five nights ago he had contemplated smash ing her skull in with a [???] [???] but that was of no importance. he thought of her naked [???] youthful body [???] as he had seen it in his dream. he had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them [???] her head stuff ed with lies and hatred [???] her belly full of ice. a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her [???] the white youthful body might slip away from him! what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly. but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. it was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated. whichever way you turned [???] the telescreen faced you. actually [???] all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note; but now [???] with time to think [???] he went over them one by one [???] as though laying out a row of instruments on a table. obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated. if she had worked in the records department it might have been [???] simple [???] but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lay [???] and he had no pretext for going there. if he had known where she lived [???] and at what time she left work [???] he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe [???] because it would mean loiter ing about outside the ministry [???] which was bound to be noticed. as for sending a letter through the mails [???] it was out of the question. by a rout ine that was not even secret [???] all letters were opened in trans it. actually [???] few people ever wrote letters. for the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send [???] there were print ed post cards with long lists of phrases [???] and you struck out the ones that were [???]. in any case he did not know the [???] name [???] let alone her address. finally he decided that the saf est place was the canteen. if he could get her at a table by herself [???] somewhere in the middle of the room [???] not too near the telescreens [???] and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all [???] these conditions endured for [???] say [???] thirty seconds [???] it might be possible to exchange a few words. for a week after this [???] life was like a restless dream. on the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it [???] the whistle having already blown. presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. they passed each other without a glance. on the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time [???] but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. his whole mind and body seemed to be afflict ed with an [???] [???] [???] a sort of [???] [???] which made every movement [???] every sound [???] every contact [???] every word that he had to speak or listen to [???] an agony. even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. he did not touch the diary during those days. if there was any relief [???] it was in his work [???] in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch. he had absolute ly no clue as to what had happened to her. there was no [???] he could make. she might have been vaporized [???] she might have committed suicide [???] she might have been [???] to the other end of oceania: worst and likeliest of all [???] she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him. the next day she reappeared. her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of [???] round her wrist. the relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds. on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. when he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall [???] and was quite alone. it was early [???] and the place was not very full. the queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter [???] then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complain ing that he had not received his tablet of [???]. but the girl was still alone when winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. he walked casually towards her [???] his eyes search ing for a place at some table beyond her. she was perhaps three metres away from him. another two seconds would do it. then a voice behind him called [???] [???]' he pretended not to hear. [???]' repeated the voice [???] more loud ly. it was no use. he turned round. a [???] [???] [???] young man named [???] [???] whom he barely knew [???] was inviting him with a smile to a vac ant place at his table. it was not safe to refuse. after having been recognized [???] he could not go and sit at a table with an un attended girl. it was too notice able. he sat down with a friendly smile. the silly blond face beam ed into his. winston had a [???] of himself smash ing a [???] right into the middle of it. the [???] table filled up a few minutes later. but she must have seen him coming towards her [???] and perhaps she would take the hint. next day he took care to arrive early. surely enough [???] she was at a table in about the same place [???] and again alone. the person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small [???] [???] [???] [???] man with a flat face and tiny [???] suspicious eyes. as winston turned away from the counter with his tray [???] he saw that the little man was making straight for the [???] table. his hopes sank again. there was a vac ant place at a table further away [???] but something in the little [???] appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. with ice at his heart winston followed. it was no use unless he could get the girl alone. at this moment there was a tremendous crash. the little man was [???] on all fours [???] his tray had gone flying [???] two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. he started to his feet with a malign ant glance at winston [???] whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. but it was all right. five seconds later [???] with a thunder ing heart [???] winston was sitting at the [???] table. he did not look at her. he [???] his tray and prompt ly began eating. it was [???] to speak at once [???] before anyone else came [???] but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. a week had gone by since she had first approach ed him. she would have changed her mind [???] she must have changed her mind! it was impossible that this affair should end success fully; such things did not happen in real life. he might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen ampleforth [???] the [???] poet [???] wandering [???] round the room with a tray [???] looking for a place to sit down. in his vague way ampleforth was attach ed to winston [???] and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him. there was perhaps a minute in which to act. both winston and the girl were eating steadily. the stuff they were eating was a thin stew [???] actually a soup [???] of [???] beans. in a low murmur winston began speaking. neither of them looked up; steadily they spoon ed the watery stuff into their mouths [???] and between [???] exchanged the few necessary words in low expression less voices.' what time do you leave work?' [???]''where can we meet?'' victory square [???] near the monument.' [???] full of telescreens.'' it [???] matter if [???] a crowd.''any signal?''no. [???] come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. and [???] look at me. just keep somewhere near me.'' what time?'' nineteen hours.'' all right.' ampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table. they did not speak again [???] and [???] so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table [???] they did not look at one another. the girl finished her lun ch quickly and made off [???] while winston stay ed to smoke a cigarette. winston was in victory square before the appointed time. he wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column [???] at the top of which big [???] statue gazed south ward towards the skies where he had vanquish ed the eurasian [???](the eastasian [???] [???] it had been [???] a few years ago) in the battle of air strip one. in the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horse back which was supposed to represent oliver cromwell. at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared. again the terrible fear seized upon winston. she was not coming [???] she had changed her mind! he walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of [???] pleasure from identifying st [???] church [???] whose bells [???] when it had bells [???] had chim ed' you owe me three [???]' then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument [???] reading or pretend ing to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. it was not safe to go near her until some more people had [???]. there were telescreens all round the pediment. but at this moment there was a din of shouting and a [???] of heavy [???] from somewhere to the left. suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. the girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush. winston followed. as he ran [???] he gather ed from some shout ed remarks that a conv oy of eurasian prisoners was passing. already a den se mass of people was block ing the south side of the square. winston [???] at normal times the kind of person who [???] to the outer edge of any kind of [???] [???] shoved [???] butt ed [???] [???] his way forward into the heart of the crowd. soon he was within [???] length of the girl [???] but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman [???] presumably his wife [???] who seemed to form an [???] wall of flesh. winston [???] himself side ways [???] and with a violent lun ge managed to drive his shoulder between them. for a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two [???] hips [???] then he had broken through [???] sweating a little. he was next to the girl. they were shoulder to shoulder [???] both staring fixed ly in front of them. a long line of trucks [???] with [???] guards armed with [???] guns standing upright in each corner [???] was passing slowly down the street. in the trucks little yellow men in [???] greenish uniforms were [???] [???] [???] close together. their sad [???] [???] faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious. occasionally when a truck [???] there was a [???] of metal: all the prisoners were wearing [???]. [???] after [???] of the sad faces passed. winston knew they were there but he saw them only [???]. the [???] shoulder [???] and her arm right down to the elbow [???] were pressed against his. her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. she had immediately taken charge of the situation [???] just as she had done in the canteen. she began speaking in the same expression less voice as before [???] with lips barely moving [???] a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.'can you hear me?' [???]''can you get sunday afternoon off?' [???]'' then listen carefully. [???] have to remember this. go to [???] [???]' with a sort of military [???] that astonish ed him [???] she outlined the route that he was to follow. a [???] rail way journey; turn left outside the station; two [???] along the road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a field; a [???] lane; a track between bush es; a dead tree with moss on it. it was as though she had a map inside her head.'can you remember all that?' she murmured finally. [???]'' you turn left [???] then right [???] then left again. and the [???] got no top bar.'' yes. what time?'' about fifteen. you may have to wait. [???] get there by another way. are you sure you remember everything?' [???]'' then get away from me as quick as you can.' she need not have told him that. but for the moment they could not [???] themselves from the crowd. the trucks were still fi ling past [???] the people still [???] gaping. at the start there had been a few bo os and hisses [???] but it came only from the party members among the crowd [???] and had soon stopped. the prevail ing emotion was simply curiosity. foreigners [???] whether from eurasia or from eastasia [???] were a kind of strange anim al. one literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners [???] and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. nor did one know what became of them [???] apart from the few who were hanged as [???]: the others simply vanished [???] presumably into [???] camps. the round [???] faces had given way to faces of a more europe an ty pe [???] dirty [???] beard ed and exhaust ed. from over [???] cheek bones eyes looked into [???] [???] sometimes with strange [???] [???] and flash ed away again. the conv oy was drawing to an end. in the last truck he could see an aged man [???] his face a mass of grizzled hair [???] standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him [???] as though he were used to having them bound together. it was almost time for winston and the girl to part. but at the last moment [???] while the crowd still hem med them in [???] her hand felt for his and gave it a fleet ing [???]. it could not have been ten seconds [???] and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together. he had time to learn every detail of her hand. he explo red the long fingers [???] the shap ely nails [???] the [???] palm with its row of callouses [???] the smooth flesh under the wrist. merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. in the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the [???] eyes were. they were probably brown [???] but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. to turn his head and look at her would have been [???] folly. with hands locked together [???] invisible among the press of bodies [???] they stared steadily in front of them [???] and instead of the eyes of the girl [???] the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mourn fully at winston out of nests of hair. chapter 2 winston picked his way up the lane through [???] light and shade [???] stepping out into [???] of gold wherever the boughs parted. under the trees to the left of him the ground was mis ty with blue bells. the air seemed to kiss [???] skin. it was the second of may. from somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the dro ning of [???]. he was a bit early. there had been no difficulties about the journey [???] and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normal ly have been. presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. in general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in london. there were no telescreens [???] of course [???] but there was always the danger of concealed [???] by which your voice might be picked up and recognized; besides [???] it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attract ing attention. for distances of less than 100 [???] it was not necessary to get your pass port [???] [???] but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the rail way stations [???] who examined the papers of any party member they found there and asked [???] questions. however [???] no patrols had appeared [???] and on the walk from the station he had made sure by [???] backward glances that he was not being followed. the train was full of proles [???] in holiday mood because of the summery weather. the [???] carriage in which he travel led was filled to over flowing by a single enormous family [???] rang ing from a tooth less [???] to a [???] baby [???] going out to spend an afternoon with [???]' in the country [???] and [???] as they freely explain ed to winston [???] to get hold of a little [???] butter. the lane widened [???] and in a minute he came to the foot path she had told him of [???] a mere [???] which [???] between the bush es. he had no watch [???] but it could not be fifteen yet. the blue bells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. he kne lt down and began pick ing some partly to pass the time away [???] but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a b unch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met. he had got together a big b unch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him [???] the [???] crack le of a foot on twigs. he went on pick ing blue bells. it was the best thing to do. it might be the girl [???] or he might have been followed after all. to look round was to show guilt. he picked another and another. a hand fell lightly on his shoulder. he looked up. it was the girl. she shook her head [???] evidently as a warning that he must keep silent [???] then parted the bush es and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood. obviously she had been that way before [???] for she [???] the [???] bits as though by habit. winston followed [???] still clasping his b unch of flowers. his first feeling was relief [???] but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him [???] with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the cur ve of her hips [???] the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all. the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves [???] him. already on the walk from the station the may sunshine had made him feel dirty and [???] [???] a creature of in doors [???] with the [???] dust of london in the por es of his skin. it occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. they came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of. the girl hopped over and forced apart the bush es [???] in which there did not seem to be an opening. when winston followed her [???] he found that they were in a natural clear ing [???] a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. the girl stopped and turned.'here we [???]' she said. he was fac ing her at several paces' distance. as yet he did not dare move nearer to her.'i [???] want to say anything in the [???]' she went on [???]' in case [???] a mike hidden there. i [???] suppose there is [???] but there could be. [???] always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. [???] all right here.' he still had not the courage to approach her. [???] all right here?' he repeated stupid ly.' yes. look at the trees.' they were small ashes [???] which at some time had been cut down and had [???] up again into a forest of poles [???] none of them thick er than [???] wrist. [???] nothing big enough to hide a mike in. besides [???] [???] been here before.' they were only making conversation. he had managed to move clos er to her now. she stood before him very upright [???] with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical [???] as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act. the blue bells had casca ded on to the ground. they seemed to have fallen of their own accord. he took her hand.' would you [???]' he said [???]' that till this moment i [???] know what colour your eyes were?' they were brown [???] he noted [???] a rather light shade of brown [???] with dark l ashes.'now that [???] seen what [???] really like [???] can you still bear to look at me?'' yes [???] easily.' [???] [???] years old. [???] got a wife that i [???] get rid of. [???] got [???] veins. [???] got five false teeth.''i [???] care [???]' said the girl. the next moment [???] it was hard to say by whose act [???] she was in his arms. at the beginning he had no feeling except sheer [???]. the youthful body was strain ed against his own [???] the mass of dark hair was against his face [???] and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth. she had clasped her arms about his neck [???] she was calling him dar ling [???] precious one [???] loved one. he had pulled her down on to the ground [???] she was utterly [???] [???] he could do what he liked with her. but the truth was that he had no physical sensation [???] except that of mere contact. all he felt was [???] and pride. he was glad that this was happening [???] but he had no physical desire. it was too soon [???] her youth and prettiness had frightened him [???] he was too much used to living without [???] did not know the reason. the girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair. she sat against him [???] putting her arm round his waist.' never mind [???] dear. [???] no hurry. [???] got the whole afternoon. [???] this a [???] [???]? i found it when i got lost once on a community hike. if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.'' what is your name?' said winston.' julia. i know yours. [???] [???] smith.''how did you find that out?''i expect [???] better at finding things out than you are [???] dear. tell me [???] what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note?' he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. it was even a sort of [???] to start off by telling the worst.'i hated the sight of [???]' he said.'i wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards. two weeks ago i thought serious ly of smash ing your head in with a [???]. if you really want to know [???] i imagined that you had something to do with the thought police.' the girl laughed delighted ly [???] evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise.' not the thought police! you [???] honest ly think that?''well [???] perhaps not exactly that. but from your general [???] because [???] young and fresh and heal thy [???] you [???] thought that [???]'' you thought i was a good party member. pure in word and deed. banners [???] processions [???] slogans [???] games [???] community [???] all that stuff. and you thought that if i had a quarter of a chance [???] denounce you as a [???] and get you killed off?'' yes [???] something of that kind. a great many young girls are like that [???] you know.' [???] this bloody thing that does [???]' she said [???] ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior [???] league and fling ing it on to a bough. then [???] as though touching her waist had reminded her of something [???] she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. she broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston. even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. it was dark and shiny [???] and was wrapped in silver paper. chocolate normal ly was [???] [???] stuff that tasted [???] as nearly as one could describe it [???] like the smoke of a rubbish fire. but at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. the first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down [???] but which was powerful and troubling.'where did you get this stuff?' he said.' black [???]' she said indifferent ly.' actually i am that sort of girl [???] to look at. [???] good at games. i was a [???] in the spies. i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior [???] league. hours and hours [???] spent past ing their bloody rot all over london. i always carry one end of a ban ner in the processions. i always look cheerful and i never [???] anything. always yell with the crowd [???] [???] what i say. [???] the only way to be safe.' the first fragment of chocolate had melted on [???] tongue. the taste was delight ful. but there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness [???] something strongly felt but not [???] to definite shape [???] like an object seen out of the corner of [???] eye. he pushed it away from him [???] aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not.' you are very [???]' he said.' you are ten or fifteen years younger than i am. what could you see to attract you in a man like me?'' it was something in your face. i thought [???] take a chance. [???] good at spotting people who [???] belong. as soon as i saw you i knew you were against them.' them [???] it appeared [???] meant the party [???] and above all the inner party [???] about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasy [???] although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. a thing that astonish ed him about her was the coarseness of her language. party members were supposed not to swear [???] and winston himself very seldom did swear [???] aloud [???] at any rate. julia [???] however [???] seemed unable to mention the party [???] and especially the inner party [???] without using the kind of words that you saw [???] up in dripping [???]. he did not dislike it. it was merely one symp tom of her revolt against the party and all its ways [???] and somehow it seemed natural and heal thy [???] like the [???] of a horse that smells bad hay. they had left the clear ing and were wandering again through the [???] shade [???] with their arms round each [???] waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two a breast. he noticed how much sof ter her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. they did not speak above a whisper. outside the clear ing [???] julia said [???] it was better to go quietly. presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. she stopped him. [???] go out into the open. there might be someone watching. [???] all right if we keep behind the boughs.' they were standing in the shade of haz el bush es. the sunlight [???] filtering through [???] leaves [???] was still hot on their faces. winston looked out into the field beyond [???] and under went a curious [???] slow shock of recognition. he knew it by sight. an old [???] [???] pasture [???] with a foot path wandering across it and a mole hill here and there. in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees sway ed just [???] in the breeze [???] and their leaves stirred faintly in den se masses like [???] hair. surely somewhere nearby [???] but out of sight [???] there must be a stream with green [???] where da ce were swim ming? [???] there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered. [???] right [???] there is a stream. [???] at the edge of the next field [???] actually. there are fish in it [???] great big ones. you can watch them lying in the [???] under the willow trees [???] waving their [???]' [???] the golden [???]' he murmured.'the golden country?' [???] nothing [???] really. a land scape [???] seen sometimes in a dream.' [???]' whispered julia. a thrush had alight ed on a bough not five metres away [???] almost at the level of their faces. perhaps it had not seen them. it was in the sun [???] they in the shade. it spread out its wings [???] fitted them carefully into place again [???] duck ed its head for a moment [???] as though making a sort of [???] to the sun [???] and then began to pour forth a tor rent of song. in the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. winston and julia cl ung together [???] [???]. the music went on and on [???] minute after minute [???] with astonish ing [???] [???] never once repeat ing itself [???] almost as though the bird were deliberate ly showing off its [???]. sometimes it stopped for a few seconds [???] spread out and re settled its wings [???] then swell ed its [???] breast and again burst into song. winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. for whom [???] for what [???] was that bird singing? no mate [???] no rival was watching it. what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? he wondered whether after all there was a [???] hidden somewhere near. he and julia had spoken only in low whispers [???] and it would not pick up what they had said [???] but it would pick up the thrush. perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small [???] [???] man was listening [???] to that. but by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. it was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that pour ed all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. he stopped thinking and merely felt. the [???] waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. he pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water. their mouths cl ung together; it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier. when they moved their faces apart again both of them sigh ed deeply. the bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings. winston put his lips against her ear. [???]' he whispered.' not [???]' she whispered back.'come back to the [???]. [???] safer.' quickly [???] with an occasion al crack le of twigs [???] they thread ed their way back to the clear ing. when they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. they were both breathing fast [???] but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth. she stood looking at him for an instant [???] then felt at the [???] of her overalls. and [???] yes! it was almost as in his dream. almost as swift ly as he had imagined it [???] she had torn her clothes off [???] and when she flung them aside it was with that same [???] gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be [???]. her body gleamed white in the sun. but for a moment he did not look at her body; his eyes were anchor ed by the [???] face with its faint [???] bold smile. he kne lt down before her and took her hands in his.' have you done this before?''of course. hundreds of [???] [???] scores of times [???] [???]''with party members?'' yes [???] always with party members.''with members of the inner party?'' not with those swine [???] no. but [???] plenty that would if they got half a chance. [???] not so holy as they make out.' his heart leapt. scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been [???]. anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. who knew [???] perhaps the party was rotten under the surface [???] its cu lt of [???] and [???] simply a sham conceal ing iniquity. if he could have infected the whole lot of them with [???] or [???] [???] how gladly he would have done so! anything to rot [???] to weak en [???] to under mine! he pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.' listen. the more men [???] had [???] the more i love you. do you understand that?'' yes [???] perfectly.''i hate purity [???] i hate goodness! i [???] want any virtue to exist anywhere. i want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.''well then [???] i ought to suit you [???] dear. [???] corrupt to the bones.'' you like doing this? i [???] mean simply me: i mean the thing in itself?''i adore it.' that was above all what he wanted to hear. not merely the love of one person but the anim al instinct [???] the simple [???] desire: that was the force that would tear the party to pieces. he pressed her down upon the grass [???] among the fallen blue bells. this time there was no difficulty. presently the rising and falling of their breasts slow ed to normal speed [???] and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. the sun seemed to have grown hot ter. they were both sleepy. he reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour. winston woke first. he sat up and watched the [???] face [???] still peaceful ly asleep [???] pillow ed on the palm of her hand. except for her mouth [???] you could not call her beautiful. there was a line or two round the eyes [???] if you looked closely. the short dark hair was [???] thick and soft. it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived. the young [???] strong body [???] now helpless in sleep [???] awoke in him a pitying [???] protect ing feeling. but the mind less tenderness that he had felt under the haz el tree [???] while the thrush was singing [???] had not quite come back. he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white fl ank. in the old days [???] he thought [???] a man looked at a [???] body and saw that it was desir able [???] and that was the end of the story. but you could not have pure love or pure lust [???]. no emotion was pure [???] because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. their embrace had been a battle [???] the clim ax a victory. it was a blow struck against the party. it was a political act. chapter 3'we can come here once [???]' said julia. [???] generally safe to use any [???] twice. but not for another month or two [???] of course.' as soon as she woke up her demean our had changed. she became ale rt and [???] [???] put her clothes on [???] knot ted the scarlet sash about her waist [???] and began [???] the details of the journey home. it seemed natural to leave this to her. she obviously had a practical cunning which winston lacked [???] and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london [???] stor ed away from [???] community [???]. the route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come [???] and brought him out at a different rail way station.' never go home the same way as you went [???]' she said [???] as though [???] an important general principle. she would leave first [???] and winston was to wait half an hour before following her. she had named a place where they could meet after work [???] four evenings hence. it was a street in one of the poorer quarters [???] where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. she would be hanging about among the stalls [???] pretend ing to be in search of [???] or [???]. if she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approach ed; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition. but with luck [???] in the middle of the crowd [???] it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting.'and now i must [???]' she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions. [???] due back at [???]. [???] got to put in two hours for the junior [???] league [???] hand ing out leaf lets [???] or something. [???] it bloody? give me a [???] [???] would you? have i got any twigs in my hair? are you sure? then [???] [???] my love [???] [???]' she flung herself into his arms [???] kiss ed him almost violently [???] and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise. even now he had not found out her surname or her address. however [???] it made no difference [???] for it was [???] that they could ever meet in doors or exchange any kind of written communication. as it happened [???] they never went back to the clear ing in the wood. during the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love. that was in another [???] known to julia [???] the [???] of a ruinous church in an [???] stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. it was a good [???] when once you got there [???] but the getting there was very dangerous. for the rest they could meet only in the streets [???] in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. in the street it was usually possible to talk [???] after a fashion. as they drift ed down the crowded pavements [???] not quite a breast and never looking at one another [???] they carried on a curious [???] [???] conversation which [???] on and off like the beams of a lighthouse [???] suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the [???] of a telescreen [???] then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence [???] then abrupt ly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot [???] then continued almost without introduction on the following day. julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation [???] which she called' talking by [???]. she was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. they were passing in silence down a [???]( julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar [???] the earth heaved [???] and the air darkened [???] and winston found himself lying on his side [???] bruised and terrified. a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. suddenly he became aware of [???] face a few [???] from his own [???] death ly white [???] as white as chalk. even her lips were white. she was dead! he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face. but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. both of their faces were thick ly coat ed with plaster. there were evenings when they reached their [???] and then had to walk past one another without a sign [???] because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicop ter was hover ing overhead. even if it had been less dangerous [???] it would still have been difficult to find time to meet. [???] working week was sixty hours [???] [???] was even longer [???] and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often [???]. julia [???] in any case [???] seldom had an evening completely free. she spent an astonish ing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations [???] [???] literature for the junior [???] league [???] prepar ing banners for hate week [???] making collections for the savings [???] [???] and [???] [???]. it paid [???] she said [???] it was [???]. if you kept the small rules [???] you could break the big ones. she even induced winston to mort gage yet another of his evenings by en rolling himself for the [???] [???] work which was done [???] by zealous party members. so [???] one evening every week [???] winston spent four hours of [???] bore dom [???] screw ing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb f uses [???] in a draughty [???] [???] works hop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens. when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up. it was a blaz ing afternoon. the air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and [???] [???] and smelt [???] of pigeon dung. they sat talking for hours on the dusty [???] [???] floor [???] one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the [???] and make sure that no one was coming. julia was [???] years old. she lived in a host el with thirty other girls [???] in the st ink of women! how i hate women!' she said [???] [???] and she worked [???] as he had guess ed [???] on the [???] machines in the fiction department. she enjoyed her work [???] which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky [???] mot or. she was' not [???] [???] but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machine ry. she could describe the whole process of compos ing a novel [???] from the general directive issu ed by the plan ning committ ee down to the final [???] by the rewrite squ ad. but she was not interested in the finished product. she [???] much care for [???]' she said. books were just a commodity that had to be produced [???] like jam or [???]. she had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked [???] of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. at school she had been captain of the [???] team and had won the [???] trophy two years running. she had been a [???] in the spies and a branch secretary in the youth league before join ing the junior [???] league. she had always borne an excellent character. she had even( an infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in [???] [???] the [???] of the fiction department which turned out cheap [???] for distribution among the proles. it was nick named muck house by the people who worked in it [???] she remarked. there she had remained for a year [???] helping to produce book lets in seal ed packets with titles like [???] stories' or' one night in a girls' school' [???] to be bought [???] by [???] youths who were under the impression that they were buy ing something [???].' what are these books like?' said winston curiously.' oh [???] ghastly rubbish. [???] bor ing [???] really. they only have six plots [???] but they sw ap them round a bit. of course i was only on the [???]. i was never in the rewrite squ ad. [???] not literary [???] [???] even enough for that.' he learned with astonish ment that all the workers in [???] [???] except the heads of the departments [???] were girls. the theory was that men [???] whose sex instincts were less [???] than those of women [???] were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.' they [???] even like having married women [???]' she added. girls are always supposed to be so pure. [???] one who [???] [???] any way. she had had her first [???] when she was sixteen [???] with a party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest.'and a good job [???]' said julia [???]' otherwise [???] have had my name out of him when he confessed.' since then there had been various others. life as she saw it was quite simple. you wanted a good time; [???] [???] meaning the party [???] wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. she seemed to think it just as natural that' they' should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. she hated the party [???] and said so in the [???] words [???] but she made no general [???] of it. except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in party doctrine. he noticed that she never used newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use. she had never heard of the brotherhood [???] and refused to believe in its existence. any kind of organized revolt against the party [???] which was bound to be a failure [???] struck her as stupid. the cle ver thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same. he wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the revolution [???] knowing nothing else [???] accept ing the party as something [???] [???] like the sky [???] not rebel ling against its authority but simply evading it [???] as a rabbit [???] a dog. they did not discuss the possibility of getting married. it was too remote to be worth thinking about. no imagin able committ ee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine [???] [???] wife [???] could somehow have been got rid of. it was hopeless even as a day dream.' what was she like [???] your wife?' said julia.' she [???] you know the newspeak word [???]? meaning naturally orthodox [???] incapable of thinking a bad thought?''no [???] i [???] know the word [???] but i know the kind of person [???] right enough.' he began telling her the story of his married life [???] but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. she described to him [???] almost as though she had seen or felt it [???] the stiffening of [???] body as soon as he touched her [???] the way in which she still seemed to be push ing him from her with all her strength [???] even when her arms were clasped tight ly round him. with julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things: katharine [???] in any case [???] had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a [???] one.'i could have stood it if it [???] been for one [???]' he said. he told her about the fri gid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week.' she hated it [???] but nothing would make her stop doing it. she used to call [???] [???] never guess.'' our duty to the [???]' said julia prompt ly.'how did you know that?' [???] been at school too [???] dear. sex talks once a month for the [???]. and in the youth movement. they rub it into you for years. i dare say it works in a lot of cases. but of course you can never tell; people are such [???]' she began to enlarge upon the subject. with julia [???] everything came back to her own [???]. as soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great [???]. unlike winston [???] she had grasp ed the inner meaning of the [???] sexual [???]. it was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the [???] control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. what was more important was that sexual privation induced [???] [???] which was desir able because it could be transform ed into [???] and [???]. the way she put it was:' when you make love [???] using up [???]; and afterwards you feel happy and [???] give a damn for anything. they [???] bear you to feel like that. they want you to be burst ing with [???] all the time. all this marching up and down and cheer ing and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. if [???] happy inside yourself [???] why should you get excited about big brother and the [???] plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?' that was very true [???] he thought. there was a direct intimate [???] between chastity and political orthodoxy. for how could the fear [???] the hatred [???] and the lunatic [???] which the party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch [???] except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force? the sex impulse was dangerous to the party [???] and the party had turned it to account. they had played a similar trick with the instinct of parent hood. the family could not actually be abolished [???] and [???] indeed [???] people were encouraged to be fond of their children [???] in almost the [???] way. the children [???] on the other hand [???] were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their [???]. the family had become in effect an extension of the thought police. it was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately. abrupt ly his mind went back to katharine. katharine would [???] have denounced him to the thought police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the [???] of his opinions. but what really recalled her to him at this moment was the [???] heat of the afternoon [???] which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. he began telling julia of something that had happened [???] or rather had failed to happen [???] on another [???] summer afternoon [???] eleven years ago. it was three or four months after they were married. they had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in kent. they had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes [???] but they took a wrong turning [???] and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quar ry. it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres [???] with [???] at the bottom. there was nobody of whom they could ask the way. as soon as she realized that they were lost katharine became very uneasy. to be away from the noisy mob of [???] even for a moment gave her a feeling of [???]. she wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start search ing in the other direction. but at this moment winston noticed some [???] of loose strife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them. one tuft was of two colours [???] [???] and [???] [???] apparent ly growing on the same root. he had never seen anything of the kind before [???] and he called to katharine to come and look at it.'look [???] katharine! look at those flowers. that clump down near the bottom. do you see [???] two different colours?' she had already turned to go [???] but she did rather fret fully come back for a moment. she even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing. he was standing a little behind her [???] and he put his hand on her waist to steady her. at this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were. there was not a human creature anywhere [???] not a leaf stirring [???] not even a bird awake. in a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden [???] was very small [???] and even if there was a [???] it would only pick up sounds. it was the hot test sleepiest hour of the afternoon. the sun blazed down upon them [???] the sweat tick led his face. and the thought struck [???].' why [???] you give her a good [???]' said julia.'i would have.'' yes [???] dear [???] you would have. i would [???] if [???] been the same person then as i am now. or perhaps i [???] not certain.''are you sorry you [???]'' yes. on the whole [???] sorry i [???]' they were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. he pulled her clos er against him. her head rest ed on his shoulder [???] the pleasant smell of her hair conquer ing the pigeon dung. she was very young [???] he thought [???] she still expected something from life [???] she did not understand that to push an in convenient person over a cliff sol ves nothing.' actually it would have made no [???]' he said.' then why are you sorry you [???] do it?'' only because i prefer a positive to a negative. in this game that [???] playing [???] we [???] win. some kinds of failure are better than other kinds [???] [???] all.' he felt her shoulders give a [???] of diss ent. she always contradict ed him when he said anything of this kind. she would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeat ed. in a way she realized that she herself was doom ed [???] that sooner or later the thought police would catch her and kill her [???] but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose. all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. she did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness [???] that the only victory lay in the far future [???] long after you were dead [???] that from the moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse.'we are the [???]' he said. [???] not dead [???]' said julia [???].' not physical ly. six months [???] a [???] years [???] [???]. i am afraid of death. you are young [???] so presumably [???] more afraid of it than i am. obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. but it makes very little difference. so long as human beings stay human [???] death and life are the same thing.'' oh [???] rubbish! which would you sooner sleep with [???] me or a [???]? [???] you enjoy being alive? [???] you like feeling: this is me [???] this is my hand [???] this is my leg [???] [???] real [???] [???] solid [???] [???] alive! [???] you like this?' she twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. he could feel her breasts [???] ripe yet firm [???] through her overalls. her body seemed to be pour ing some of its youth and vigour into his.' yes [???] i like [???]' he said.' then stop talking about dying. and now listen [???] dear [???] [???] got to fix up about the next time we meet. we may as well go back to the place in the wood. [???] given it a good long rest. but you must get there by a different way this time. [???] got it all planned out. you take the [???] look [???] [???] draw it out for you.' and in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust [???] and with a twig from a [???] nest began drawing a map on the floor. chapter 4 winston looked round the [???] little room above mr [???] shop. beside the window the enormous bed was made up [???] with ragged blankets and a cover less bol ster. the [???] clock with the [???] face was tick ing away on the [???]. in the corner [???] on the gate leg table [???] the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the [???]. in the fender was a batter ed tin [???] [???] a saucepan [???] and two cups [???] provided by mr charrington. winston lit the burn er and set a pan of water to bo il. he had brought an [???] full of victory coffee and some [???] tab lets. the [???] hands said [???]: it was [???] really. she was coming at [???]. folly [???] folly [???] his heart kept saying: conscious [???] [???] [???] [???] folly. of all the crimes that a party member could commit [???] this one was the least possible to conceal. actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision [???] of the glass paperweight mirror ed by the surface of the gate leg table. as he had foreseen [???] mr charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room. he was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him. nor did he seem shock ed or become [???] knowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purpose of a [???]. instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities [???] with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible. privacy [???] he said [???] was a very [???] thing. everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. and when they had such a place [???] it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. he even [???] seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so [???] added that there were two entries to the house [???] one of them through the back yard [???] which gave on an alley. under the window somebody was singing. winston peep ed out [???] secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. the june sun was still high in the sky [???] and in the [???] court below [???] a monstrous woman [???] solid as a norm an pillar [???] with brawny red fore arms and a sack ing apron strapped about her middle [???] was [???] to and fro between a wash tub and a clothes line [???] pegging out a series of square white things which winston recognized as babies' [???]. whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contr alto: it was only an [???] fancy. it passed like an [???] dye [???] but a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred! they' ave stolen my'eart aw ye! the tune had been haunt ing london for weeks past. it was one of count less similar songs publish ed for the benefit of the proles by a [???] of the music department. the words of these songs were compos ed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a [???]. but the woman sang so tune fully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. he could hear the woman singing and the scra pe of her shoes on the flag stones [???] and the cries of the children in the street [???] and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic [???] and yet the room seemed curiously silent [???] thanks to the absence of a telescreen. folly [???] folly [???] folly! he thought again. it was [???] that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. but the temptation of having a [???] that was truly their own [???] in doors and near at hand [???] had been too much for both of them. for some time after their visit to the church [???] it had been impossible to arrange meetings. working hours had been [???] increased in [???] of hate week. it was more than a month distant [???] but the enormous [???] complex preparations that it [???] were throwing extra work on to everybody. finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day. they had agreed to go back to the clear ing in the wood. on the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. as usual [???] winston hardly looked at julia as they drift ed towards one another in the crowd [???] but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual. [???] all [???]' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak.' tomorrow [???] i mean.' [???]'' tomorrow afternoon. i [???] come.'' why not?'' oh [???] the usual reason. [???] started early this time.' for a moment he was violently angry. during the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed. at the beginning there had been little true [???] in it. their first [???] had been simply an act of the will. but after the second time it was different. the smell of her hair [???] the taste of her mouth [???] the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him [???] or into the air all round him. she had become a physical necessity [???] something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. when she said that she could not come [???] he had the feeling that she was cheating him. but just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. she gave the tips of his fingers a quick [???] that seemed to invite not desire but affection. it struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular dis appointment must be a normal [???] [???] event; and a deep tenderness [???] such as he had not felt for her before [???] suddenly took hold of him. he wished that they were a married couple of ten years' standing. he wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear [???] talking of [???] and buy ing odds and ends for the household. he wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. it was not actually at that moment [???] but at some time on the following day [???] that the idea of rent ing mr [???] room had occurred to him. when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness. both of them knew that it was lunacy. it was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. as he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love. it was curious how that [???] horror moved in and out of [???] consciousness. there it lay [???] fixed in future times [???] preced ing death as surely as 99 preced es 100. one could not avoid it [???] but one could perhaps [???] it: and yet instead [???] every now and again [???] by a conscious [???] wilful act [???] one chose to short en the interv al before it happened. at this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. julia burst into the room. she was carrying a [???] of coarse brown [???] [???] such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry. he started forward to take her in his arms [???] but she dis engaged herself rather hurried ly [???] partly because she was still holding the [???].' half a [???]' she said.'just let me show you what [???] brought. did you bring some of that filthy victory coffee? i thought you would. you can chuck it away again [???] because we [???] be need ing it. look here.' she fell on her knees [???] threw open the bag [???] and tumbled out some spanners and a [???] that filled the top part of it. underneath were a number of neat paper packets. the first packet that she passed to winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. it was filled with some kind of heavy [???] [???] stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.' it [???] sugar?' he said.' real sugar. not [???] [???] sugar. and [???] a loaf of [???] white bread [???] not our bloody [???] a little pot of jam. and [???] a tin of [???] look! this is the one [???] really proud of. i had to wrap a bit of sack ing round it [???] [???]' but she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. the smell was already filling the room [???] a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood [???] but which one did occasionally meet with even now [???] blowing down a [???] before a door [???] [???] or diff using itself mysterious ly in a crowded street [???] [???] for an instant and then lost again. [???] [???]' he murmured [???]' real coffee.' [???] inner party coffee. [???] a whole kilo [???]' she said.'how did you manage to get hold of all these things?' [???] all inner party stuff. [???] nothing those swine [???] have [???] nothing. but of course waiters and servants and people pinch things [???] [???] [???] i got a little packet of tea as well.' winston had [???] down beside her. he tore open a corner of the packet. [???] real tea. not blackberry leaves.' [???] been a lot of tea about lately. [???] captured india [???] or [???]' she said vaguely.' but listen [???] dear. i want you to turn your back on me for three minutes. go and sit on the other side of the bed. [???] go too near the window. and [???] turn round till i tell you.' winston gazed [???] through the muslin curtain. down in the yard the [???] woman was still marching to and fro between the wash tub and the line. she took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling: they sye that time [???] all things [???] they sye you can always forget; but the smiles an' the tears [???] the years they twist my [???] yet! she knew the whole drivelling song by heart [???] it seemed. her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air [???] very tune ful [???] charged with a sort of happy melancholy. one had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content [???] if the june evening had been endless and the supply of clothes [???] [???] to remain there for a thousand years [???] pegging out [???] and singing rubbish. it struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the party singing alone and [???]. it would even have seemed slightly un orthodox [???] a dangerous [???] [???] like talking to one self. perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about.' you can turn round [???]' said julia. he turned round [???] and for a second almost failed to recognize her. what he had actually expected was to see her naked. but she was not naked. the transformation that had happened was much more surpris ing than that. she had painted her face. she must have slipped into some shop in the [???] quarters and bought herself a complete set of [???] materials. her lips were deeply [???] [???] her cheeks rouged [???] her nose powder ed; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them bright er. it was not very [???] done [???] but [???] standards in such matters were not high. he had never before seen or imagined a woman of the party with [???] on her face. the [???] in her appearance was startling. with just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier [???] but [???] above all [???] far more [???]. her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect. as he took her in his arms a wave of [???] vio lets flood ed his [???]. he remembered the [???] of a basement kitchen [???] and a [???] [???] mouth. it was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.' scent too!' he said.' yes [???] dear [???] scent too. and do you know what [???] going to do next? [???] going to get hold of a real [???] frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody [???]. [???] wear silk stockings and [???] shoes! in this room [???] going to be a woman [???] not a party comrade.' they flung their clothes off and climb ed into the huge [???] bed. it was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence. until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and [???] body [???] with the [???] veins standing out on his cal ves and the dis coloured patch over his ank le. there were no sheets [???] but the blank et they lay on was thread bare and smooth [???] and the size and springiness of the bed astonish ed both of them. [???] sure to be full of bugs [???] but who cares?' said julia. one never saw a double bed [???] [???] except in the hom es of the proles. winston had occasionally slept in one in his boy hood: julia had never been in one before [???] so far as she could remember. presently they fell asleep for a little while. when winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. he did not stir [???] because julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. most of her [???] had [???] itself to his own face or the bol ster [???] but a light stain of rou ge still brought out the beauty of her cheek bone. a yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fire place [???] where the water in the pan was boiling fast. down in the yard the woman had stopped singing [???] but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this [???] in the cool of a summer evening [???] a man and a woman with no clothes on [???] making love when they chose [???] talking of what they chose [???] not feeling any compulsion to get up [???] simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? julia woke up [???] rubb ed her eyes [???] and raised herself on her elbow to look at the [???].' half that [???] boiled [???]' she said. [???] get up and make some coffee in another moment. [???] got an hour. what time do they cut the lights off at your [???]' [???] thirty.' [???] [???] at the host el. but you have to get in earlier than that [???] [???]! get out [???] you filthy [???]' she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed [???] seized a shoe from the floor [???] and sent it hurt ling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm [???] exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein [???] that morning during the two minutes hate.' what was it?' he said in surprise.'a rat. i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the [???]. [???] a hole down there. i gave him a good fright [???] [???]' [???]' murmured winston.' in this room!' [???] all over the [???]' said julia indifferent ly as she lay down again. [???] even got them in the kitchen at the host el. some parts of london are swar ming with them. did you know they attack children? yes [???] they do. in some of these streets a woman [???] leave a baby alone for two minutes. [???] the great huge brown ones that do it. and the [???] thing is that the brutes [???]' [???] go on!' said winston [???] with his eyes tight ly shut.' dearest! [???] gone quite pale. [???] the matter? do they make you feel sick?''of all horrors in the [???] rat!' she pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him [???] as though to re assure him with the warmth of her body. he did not re open his eyes immediately. for several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a night mare which had [???] from time to time throughout his life. it was always very much the same. he was standing in front of a wall of darkness [???] and on the other side of it there was something [???] [???] something too dreadful to be faced. in the dream his deep est feeling was always one of [???] [???] because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. with a deadly effort [???] like wrench ing a piece out of his own brain [???] he could even have dragged the thing into the open. he always woke up without discover ing what it was: but somehow it was connected with what julia had been saying when he cut her short. [???] [???]' he said [???] [???] nothing. i [???] like rats [???] [???] all.' [???] wor ry [???] dear [???] [???] not going to have the filthy brutes in here. [???] stuff the hole with a bit of sack ing before we go. and next time we come here [???] bring some plaster and bung it up [???]' already the black instant of panic was [???]. feeling slightly ashamed of himself [???] he sat up against the bedhead. julia got out of bed [???] pulled on her overalls [???] and made the coffee. the smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become [???]. what was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar [???] a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of [???]. with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other [???] julia wandered about the room [???] glancing indifferent ly at the bookcase [???] pointing out the best way of repair ing the gate leg table [???] [???] herself down in the ragged [???] to see if it was comfortable [???] and examining the absurd [???] clock with a sort of toler ant [???]. she brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light. he took it out of her hand [???] [???] [???] as always [???] by the soft [???] rain watery appearance of the glass.' what is it [???] do you think?' said julia.'i [???] think [???] [???] mean [???] i [???] think it was ever put to any use. [???] what i like about it. [???] a little ch unk of history that [???] forgotten to alter. [???] a message from a hundred years ago [???] if one knew how to read it.''and that picture over [???] nodded at the [???] on the opposite [???] that be a hundred years old?''more. two hundred [???] i dare say. one [???] tell. [???] impossible to discover the age of anything [???]' she went over to look at it. [???] where that brute stuck his nose [???]' she said [???] kick ing the [???] immediately below the picture.' what is this place? [???] seen it before somewhere.' [???] a church [???] or at least it used to be. st clement danes its name was.' the fragment of rhyme that mr charrington had taught him came back into his head [???] and he added [???]: [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] to his astonish ment she capped the line:' you owe me three farthings [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] when will you pay me? say the bells of old [???]''i [???] remember how it goes on after that. but any way i remember it ends up [???] [???] comes a candle to light you to bed [???] here comes a chopper to chop off your [???]' it was like the two hal ves of a counter sign. but there must be another line after'the bells of old [???]. perhaps it could be dug out of mr [???] memory [???] if he were suitably prompt ed.' who taught you that?' he said.' my grandfather. he used to say it to me when i was a little girl. he was vaporized when i was [???] any rate [???] he disappeared. i wonder what a lemon [???]' she added [???]. [???] seen [???]. [???] a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.''i can remember [???]' said winston.' they were quite common in the fifties. they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them.''i bet that [???] got bugs behind [???]' said julia. [???] take it down and give it a good clean some day. i suppose [???] almost time we were leaving. i must start washing this paint off. what a bore! [???] get the lip stick off your face afterwards.' winston did not get up for a few minutes more. the room was darkening. he turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight. the [???] interest ing thing was not the fragment of cor al but the interior of the glass itself. there was such a depth of it [???] and yet it was almost as trans parent as air. it was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky [???] enclosing a tiny world with its [???] complete. he had the feeling that he could get inside it [???] and that in fact he was inside it [???] along with the [???] bed and the gate leg table [???] and the clock and the steel [???] and the paperweight itself. the paperweight was the room he was in [???] and the cor al was [???] life and his own [???] fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal. chapter 5 syme had vanished. a morning came [???] and he was missing from work: a few thought less people comment ed on his absence. on the next day nobody mentioned him. on the third day winston went into the [???] of the records department to look at the [???]. one of the notices carried a print ed list of the members of the chess committ ee [???] of whom syme had been one. it looked almost exactly as it had looked [???] had been crossed [???] it was one name short er. it was enough. syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed. the weather was baking hot. in the [???] ministry the window less [???] [???] rooms kept their normal temperature [???] but outside the pavements [???] [???] feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hours was a horror. the preparations for hate week were in full swing [???] and the staffs of all the ministries were working overtime. processions [???] meetings [???] military parades [???] lectures [???] wax works [???] displays [???] film shows [???] telescreen [???] all had to be organized; stands had to be erected [???] [???] built [???] slogans coin ed [???] songs written [???] rumours circulated [???] photographs faked. [???] unit in the fiction department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of [???] [???]. winston [???] in addition to his regular work [???] spent long periods every day in going through back files of'the times' and altering and [???] news items which were to be quoted in speeches. late at night [???] when crowds of row dy proles roamed the streets [???] the town had a curiously [???] air. the rocket bombs cra shed often er than ever [???] and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous [???] which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours. the new tune which was to be the [???] of hate week(the hate song [???] it was called) had already been compos ed and was being endless ly [???] on the telescreens. it had a savage [???] bark ing [???] which could not exactly be called music [???] but resembled the beating of a drum. roar ed out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet [???] it was terrifying. the proles had taken a fancy to it [???] and in the midnight streets it compet ed with the [???]' it was only a hopeless fancy'. the parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day [???] [???] [???] on a comb and a piece of toil et paper. [???] evenings were fuller than ever. squads of [???] [???] organized by parsons [???] were prepar ing the street for hate week [???] [???] banners [???] painting posters [???] [???] [???] on the roofs [???] and perilously [???] wires across the street for the reception of streamers. parsons boast ed that victory mansions alone would display four hundred metres of [???]. he was in his native element and as happy as a lark. the heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. he was everywhere at once [???] push ing [???] pulling [???] saw ing [???] hammering [???] [???] [???] jolly ing everyone along with comrade ly [???] and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an [???] supply of [???] sweat. a new poster had suddenly appeared all over london. it had no caption [???] and represent ed simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier [???] three or four metres high [???] stri ding forward with expression less [???] face and enormous boots [???] a sub machine gun pointed from his hip. from whatever angle you looked at the poster [???] the [???] of the gun [???] magnified by the [???] [???] seemed to be pointed straight at you. the thing had been plaster ed on every blank space on every wall [???] even [???] the [???] of big brother. the proles [???] normal ly [???] about the war [???] were being la shed into one of their periodical frenzies of [???]. as though to [???] with the general mood [???] the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual. one fell on a crowded film theatre in stepney [???] bury ing several hundred [???] among the ruins. the whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long [???] trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting. another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces. there were further angry demonstrations [???] goldstein was burned in [???] [???] hundreds of copies of the poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames [???] and a number of shops were loo ted in the [???]; then a rumour flew round that spies were direct ing the rocket bombs by means of wire less waves [???] and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perish ed of [???]. in the room over mr [???] shop [???] when they could get there [???] julia and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window [???] naked for the sake of coolness. the rat had never come back [???] but the bugs had [???] hideous ly in the heat. it did not seem to matter. dirty or clean [???] the room was paradise. as soon as they arrived they would [???] everything with pepper bought on the black market [???] tear off their clothes [???] and make love with sweating bodies [???] then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had [???] and were massing for the [???]. four [???] five [???] [???] times they met during the month of june. winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. he seemed to have lost the need for it. he had grown fat ter [???] his [???] ulcer had [???] [???] leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ank le [???] his fits of cough ing in the early morning had stopped. the process of life had ceased to be intolerable [???] he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. now that they had a secure [???] [???] almost a home [???] it did not even seem a hard ship that they could only meet [???] and for a couple of hours at a time. what mattered was that the room over the [???] should exist. to know that it was there [???] [???] [???] was almost the same as being in it. the room was a world [???] a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. mr charrington [???] thought winston [???] was another extinct anim al. he usually stopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. the old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors [???] and on the other hand to have almost no customers. he led a ghostlike existence between the tiny [???] dark shop [???] and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained [???] among other things [???] an [???] ancient [???] with an enormous horn. he seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. wandering about among his worthless stock [???] with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bow ed shoulders in the velvet jack et [???] he had always vaguely the air of being a collect or rather than a tradesman. with a sort of faded [???] he would finger this scrap of rubbish or [???] china [???] [???] the painted lid of a broken snuff box [???] a pinch beck lock et containing a strand of some [???] [???] [???] asking that winston should buy it [???] merely that he should admire it. to talk to him was like listening to the tink ling of a [???] [???]. he had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes. there was one about four and twenty black birds [???] and another about a cow with a [???] horn [???] and another about the death of poor cock robin.' it just occurred to me you might be [???]' he would say with a [???] little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. but he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme. both of them [???] a way [???] it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long. there were times when the fact of imp ending death seemed as [???] as the bed they lay on [???] and they would cling together with a sort of despair ing [???] [???] like a damned soul grasp ing at his last mor sel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. but there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. so long as they were actually in this room [???] they both felt [???] no harm could come to them. getting there was difficult and dangerous [???] but the room itself was sanctuary. it was as when winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight [???] with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world [???] and that once inside it time could be arrested. often they gave themselves up to day dreams of escape. their luck would hold [???] [???] and they would carry on their [???] [???] just like this [???] for the remain der of their natural lives. or katharine would die [???] and by subtle [???] winston and julia would succeed in getting married. or they would commit suicide together. or they would disapp ear [???] alter themselves out of recognition [???] learn to speak with [???] accents [???] get jobs in a factory and live out their lives [???] in a [???]. it was all nonsense [???] as they both knew. in reality there was no escape. even the one plan that was [???] [???] suicide [???] they had no intention of carrying out. to hang on from day to day and from week to week [???] spin ning out a present that had no future [???] seemed an [???] instinct [???] just as [???] lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air [???]. sometimes [???] too [???] they talked of engag ing in active rebellion against the party [???] but with no notion of how to take the first step. even if the fabulous brotherhood was a reality [???] there still remained the difficulty of finding [???] way into it. he told her of the strange [???] that existed [???] or seemed to exist [???] between himself and [???] [???] and of the impulse he sometimes felt [???] simply to walk into [???] presence [???] announce that he was the enemy of the party [???] and demand his help. curiously enough [???] this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. she was used to judg ing people by their faces [???] and it seemed natural to her that winston should believe [???] to be trust worthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes. moreover she took it for granted that everyone [???] or nearly everyone [???] secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. but she refused to believe that wide spread [???] organized opposition existed or could exist. the tales about goldstein and his underground army [???] she said [???] were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. times beyond number [???] at party [???] and [???] demonstrations [???] she had shout ed at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the fain test belief. when public trials were happening she had taken her place in the [???] from the youth league who surrounded the courts from morning to night [???] chant ing at intervals' death to the traitors!' during the two minutes hate she always excell ed all others in shouting insults at goldstein. yet she had only the [???] idea of who goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent. she had grown up since the revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties. such a thing as an [???] political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the party was [???]. it would always exist [???] and it would always be the same. you could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or [???] at most [???] by [???] acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up. in some ways she was far more acute than winston [???] and far less [???] to party [???]. once when he happened in some [???] to mention the war against eurasia [???] she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. the rocket bombs which fell daily on london were probably fi red by the government of oceania itself [???]'just to keep people frightened'. this was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid burst ing out laughing. but she only question ed the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life. often she was ready to accept the official [???] [???] simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. she believed [???] for instance [???] having learnt it at school [???] that the party had invented [???].( in his own school days [???] winston remembered [???] in the late fifties [???] it was only the helicop ter that the party claim ed to have invented; a dozen years later [???] when julia was at school [???] it was already claim ing the [???]; one generation more [???] and it would be claim ing the steam engine.) and when he told her that [???] had been in existence before he was born and long before the revolution [???] the fact struck her as totally [???]. after all [???] what did it matter who had invented [???]? it was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that oceania [???] four years ago [???] had been at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia. it was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparent ly she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed.'i thought [???] always been at war with [???]' she said vaguely. it frightened him a little. the invention of [???] dat ed from long before her birth [???] but the [???] in the war had happened only four years ago [???] well after she was grown up. he argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. in the end he succeeded in forc ing her memory back until she did dim ly recall that at one time eastasia and not eurasia had been the enemy. but the issue still struck her as un important.' who cares?' she said impatient ly. [???] always one bloody war after another [???] and one knows the news is all lies [???]' sometimes he talked to her of the records department and the impud ent forgeries that he committed there. such things did not appear to horrify her. she did not feel the [???] opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths. he told her the story of jones [???] aaronson [???] and [???] and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers. it did not make much impression on her. at first [???] indeed [???] she failed to grasp the point of the story.' were they friends of yours?' she said.'no [???] i never knew them. they were inner party members. besides [???] they were far older men than i was. they belong ed to the old days [???] before the revolution. i barely knew them by sight.'' then what was there to wor ry about? people are being killed off all the time [???] [???] they?' he tried to make her understand.' this was an [???] case. it [???] just a question of somebody being killed. do you realize that the past [???] starting from yesterday [???] has been actually abolished? if it survives anywhere [???] [???] in a few solid objects with no words attach ed to them [???] like that lump of glass there. already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the years before the revolution. every record has been destroyed or falsified [???] every book has been re written [???] every picture has been repainted [???] every statue and street and building has been renamed [???] every date has been altered. and that process is continu ing day by day and minute by minute. history has stopped. nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right. i know [???] of course [???] that the past is falsified [???] but it would never be possible for me to prove it [???] even when i did the falsification myself. after the thing is done [???] no evidence ever remains. the only evidence is inside my own mind [???] and i [???] know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. just in that one instance [???] in my whole life [???] i did possess actual concrete evidence after the [???] after it.''and what good was that?'' it was no good [???] because i threw it away a few minutes later. but if the same thing happened today [???] i should keep it.''well [???] i [???]' said julia. [???] quite ready to take risks [???] but only for something worth while [???] not for bits of old newspap er. what could you have done with it even if you had kept it?'' not much [???] perhaps. but it was evidence. it might have planted a few doubts here and there [???] supposing that [???] dared to show it to anybody. i [???] imagine that we can alter anything in our own life time. but one can imagine little knots of resistance spring ing up here and [???] groups of people band ing themselves together [???] and gradually growing [???] and even leaving a few records behind [???] so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off.' [???] not interested in the next generation [???] dear. [???] interested in us.' [???] only a rebel from the waist [???]' he told her. she thought this [???] witty and flung her arms round him in delight. in the [???] of party doctrine she had not the fain test interest. whenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc [???] doublethink [???] the mut ability of the past [???] and the denial of objective reality [???] and to use newspeak words [???] she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing. one knew that it was all rubbish [???] so why let one self be worried by it? she knew when to cheer and when to boo [???] and that was all one needed. if he persisted in talking of such subjects [???] she had a [???] habit of falling asleep. she was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. talking to her [???] he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. in a way [???] the [???] of the party imposed itself most success fully on people incapable of understanding it. they could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality [???] because they never fully grasp ed the enormity of what was demanded of them [???] and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. by lack of understanding they remained sane. they simply swallowed everything [???] and what they swallowed did them no harm [???] because it left no [???] behind [???] just as a grain of corn will pass [???] through the body of a bird. chapter 6 it had happened at last. the expected message had come. all his life [???] it seemed to him [???] he had been waiting for this to happen. he was walking down the long corrid or at the ministry and he was almost at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. the person [???] whoever it was [???] gave a small cough [???] evidently as a prelude to speaking. winston stopped abrupt ly and turned. it was [???]. at last they were face to face [???] and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away. his heart bound ed violently. he would have been incapable of speaking. [???] [???] however [???] had continued forward in the same movement [???] laying a friendly hand for a moment on [???] arm [???] so that the two of them were walking side by side. he began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that [???] him from the majority of inner party members.'i had been hop ing for an opportunity of talking to [???]' he said.'i was reading one of your newspeak articles in'the times' the other day. you take a scholar ly interest in newspeak [???] i believe?' winston had recovered part of his [???].' hardly [???]' he said. [???] only an [???]. [???] not my subject. i have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language.'' but you write it very [???]' said [???].' that is not only my own opinion. i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. his name has slipped my memory for the moment.' again [???] heart stirred painful ly. it was [???] that this was anything other than a reference to syme. but syme was not only dead [???] he was abolished [???] an un person. any [???] reference to him would have been mortal ly dangerous. [???] remark must obviously have been intended as a signal [???] a [???]. by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into [???]. they had continued to stro ll slowly down the corrid or [???] but now [???] halt ed. with the curious [???] [???] friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he re settled his spectacles on his nose. then he went on:' what i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed you had used two words which have become [???]. but they have only become so very recently. have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary?' [???]' said winston.'i [???] think it had been issu ed yet. we are still using the ninth in the records department.''the tenth edition is not due to appear for some months [???] i believe. but a few advance copies have been circulated. i have one myself. it might interest you to look at it [???] perhaps?''very much [???]' said winston [???] immediately seeing where this tend ed.'some of the new developments are most ingenious. the reduction in the number of [???] is the point that will appeal to you [???] i think. let me see [???] shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary? but i am afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind. perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you? wait. let me give you my address.' they were standing in front of a telescreen. somewhat [???] [???] felt two of his pockets and then produced a small [???] note book and a gold [???]. immediately beneath the telescreen [???] in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing [???] he [???] an address [???] tore out the page and handed it to winston.'i am usually at home in the [???]' he said.'if not [???] my servant will give you the dictionary.' he was gone [???] leaving winston holding the scrap of paper [???] which this time there was no need to conceal. nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it [???] and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers. they had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most. there was only one meaning that the [???] could possibly have. it had been contrived as a way of letting winston know [???] address. this was necessary [???] because except by direct [???] it was never possible to discover where anyone lived. there were no directories of any kind.'if you ever want to see me [???] this is where i can be [???]' was what [???] had been saying to him. perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. but at any rate [???] one thing was certain. the conspiracy that he had dream ed of did exist [???] and he had reached the outer edges of it. he knew that sooner or later he would obey [???] summons. perhaps tomorrow [???] perhaps after a long [???] was not certain. what was happening was only the [???] of a process that had started years ago. the first step had been a secret [???] involuntary thought [???] the second had been the opening of the diary. he had moved from thoughts to words [???] and now from words to actions. the last step was something that would happen in the ministry of love. he had accepted it. the end was contained in the beginning. but it was frightening: or [???] more exactly [???] it was like a foretaste of death [???] like being a little less alive. even while he was speaking to [???] [???] when the meaning of the words had sunk in [???] a ch illy [???] feeling had taken possession of his body. he had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave [???] and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him. chapter 7 winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. julia rolled sleepily against him [???] murmur ing something that might have been [???] the matter?''i [???]' he began [???] and stopped short. it was too complex to be put into words. there was the dream itself [???] and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking. he lay back with his eyes shut [???] still sodden in the [???] of the dream. it was a vast [???] [???] dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a land scape on a summer evening after rain. it had all occurred inside the glass paperweight [???] but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky [???] and inside the dome everything was flood ed with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances. the dream had also been compreh ended [???] [???] in some sense it had consisted [???] gesture of the arm made by his mother [???] and made again thirty years later by the je wish woman he had seen on the news film [???] trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets [???] before the helicop ter blew them both to pieces.' do you [???]' he said [???]' that until this moment i believed i had murdered my mother?'' why did you murder her?' said julia [???] almost asleep.'i [???] murder her. not [???]' in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother [???] and within a few moments of waking the [???] of small events [???] it had all come back. it was a memory that he must have deliberate ly pushed out of his consciousness over many years. he was not certain of the date [???] but he could not have been less than ten years old [???] possibly twelve [???] when it had happened. his father had disappeared some time earlier [???] how much earlier he could not remember. he remembered better the rackety [???] uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about [???] and the shelter ing in tube stations [???] the piles of rubb le everywhere [???] the [???] proclamations post ed at street corners [???] the [???] of youths in shirts all the same colour [???] the enormous queues outside the [???] [???] the [???] [???] fire in the [???] all [???] the fact that there was never enough to eat. he remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in [???] round [???] and rubbish heaps [???] pick ing out the ribs of [???] leaves [???] potato peelings [???] sometimes even scraps of stale [???] from which they carefully scraped away the [???]; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travel led over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed [???] and which [???] when they [???] over the bad patch es in the road [???] sometimes spilt a few fragments of [???]. when his father disappeared [???] his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief [???] but a sudden change came over her. she seemed to have become completely spirit less. it was evident even to winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen. she did everything that was [???] [???] washed [???] mended [???] made the bed [???] swept the floor [???] dust ed the [???] very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion [???] like an [???] [???] moving of its own accord. her large shap ely body seemed to [???] naturally into stillness. for hours at a time she would sit almost [???] on the bed [???] nurs ing his young sister [???] a tiny [???] ailing [???] very silent child of two or three [???] with a face made simian by thinness. very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. he was aware [???] in spite of his youthfulness and [???] [???] that this was somehow connected with the [???] thing that was about to happen. he remembered the room where they lived [???] a dark [???] [???] room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white [???]. there was a gas ring in the fender [???] and a shelf where food was kept [???] and on the landing outside there was a brown [???] sink [???] common to several rooms. he remembered his [???] statue sque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. above all he remembered his continuous hunger [???] and the fierce sor did battles at meal times. he would ask his mother [???] [???] over and over again [???] why there was not more food [???] he would shout and storm at her(he even remembered the tones of his voice [???] which was beginning to break [???] and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way) [???] or he would attempt a [???] note of path os in his efforts to get more than his share. his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. she took it for granted that he [???]'the boy' [???] should have the big gest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. at every meal she would beseech him not to be sel fish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food [???] but it was no use. he would cry out with rage when she stopped lad ling [???] he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands [???] he would grab bits from his [???] plate. he knew that he was starving the other two [???] but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. between meals [???] if his mother did not stand guard [???] he was constantly [???] at the wretched store of food on the shelf. one day a chocolate ration was issu ed. there had been no such issue for weeks or months past. he remembered quite clearly that precious little mor sel of chocolate. it was a [???] slab( they still talked about [???] in those days) between the three of them. it was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. suddenly [???] as though he were listening to somebody else [???] winston heard himself demand ing in a loud [???] voice that he should be given the whole piece. his mother told him not to be greedy. there was a long [???] [???] argument that went round and round [???] with shouts [???] whines [???] tears [???] remonstrances [???] bargain ings. his tiny sister [???] [???] to her mother with both hands [???] exactly like a baby monkey [???] sat looking over her shoulder at him with large [???] mourn ful eyes. in the end his mother broke off [???] of the chocolate and gave it to winston [???] giving the other quarter to his sister. the little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully [???] perhaps not knowing what it was. winston stood watching her for a moment. then with a sudden swift spring he had snatch ed the piece of chocolate out of his [???] hand and was [???] for the door.' winston [???] winston!' his mother called after him.'come back! give your sister back her chocolate!' he stopped [???] but did not come back. his [???] anxious eyes were fixed on his face. even now he was thinking about the thing [???] he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening. his sister [???] conscious of having been robb ed of something [???] had set up a feeble wail. his mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. he turned and fled down the stairs [???] with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand. he never saw his mother again. after he had devour ed the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours [???] until hunger drove him home. when he came back his mother had disappeared. this was already becoming normal at that time. nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. they had not taken any clothes [???] not even his [???] over coat. to this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. it was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a [???] camp. as for his sister [???] she might have been removed [???] like winston himself [???] to one of the [???] for homeless children [???] centres [???] they were called) which had grown up as a res ult of the civil war [???] or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother [???] or simply left somewhere or other to die. the dream was still vivid in his mind [???] especially the [???] protect ing gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. his mind went back to another dream of two months ago. exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy [???] bed [???] with the child [???] to her [???] so she had sat in the sun ken ship [???] far underneath him [???] and drown ing deeper every minute [???] but still looking up at him through the darkening water. he told julia the story of his [???] dis appearance. without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.'i expect you were a beastly little swine in those [???]' she said in distinctly.' all children are swine.'' yes. but the real point of the [???]' from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. he would have liked to continue talking about his mother. he did not suppose [???] from what he could remember of her [???] that she had been an unusual woman [???] still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility [???] a kind of purity [???] simply because the standards that she obey ed were private ones. her feelings were her own [???] and could not be altered from outside. it would not have occurred to her that an action which is [???] thereby becomes meaning less. if you loved someone [???] you loved him [???] and when you had nothing else to give [???] you still gave him love. when the last of the chocolate was gone [???] his mother had clasped the child in her arms. it was no use [???] it changed nothing [???] it did not produce more chocolate [???] it did not ave rt the [???] death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it. the [???] woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm [???] which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper. the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses [???] mere feelings [???] were of no account [???] while at the same time robb ing you of all power over the material world. when once you were in the grip of the party [???] what you felt or did not feel [???] what you did or [???] from doing [???] made literally no difference. whatever happened you vanished [???] and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. you were lifted clean out of the stream of history. and yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed [???] [???] because they were not attempt ing to alter history. they were govern ed by private loyalties which they did not question. what mattered were individual relation ships [???] and a completely helpless gesture [???] an embrace [???] a tear [???] a word spoken to a dying man [???] could have value in itself. the proles [???] it suddenly occurred to him [???] had remained in this condition. they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea [???] they were loyal to one another. for the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an ine rt force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. the proles had stay ed human. they had not become hardened inside. they had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to [???] by conscious effort. and in thinking this he remembered [???] without apparent [???] [???] how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kick ed it into the gutter as though it had been a [???].'the proles are human [???]' he said aloud.'we are not human.'' why not?' said julia [???] who had woken up again. he thought for a little while.' has it ever occurred to [???]' he said [???]' that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before [???] too late [???] and never see each other again?'' yes [???] dear [???] it has occurred to me [???] several times. but [???] not going to do it [???] all the same.' [???] been [???]' he said' but it [???] last much longer. [???] young. you look normal and innocent. if you keep clear of people like me [???] you might stay alive for another fifty years.''no. [???] thought it all out. what you do [???] [???] going to do. and [???] be too down hearted. [???] rather good at staying alive.''we may be together for another six [???] [???] no knowing. at the end [???] certain to be apart. do you realize how utterly alone we shall be? when once they get hold of us there will be nothing [???] literally nothing [???] that either of us can do for the other. if i confess [???] [???] shoot you [???] and if i refuse to confess [???] [???] shoot you just the same. nothing that i can do or say [???] or stop myself from saying [???] will put off your death for as much as five minutes. neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead. we shall be utterly without power of any kind. the one thing that matters is that we [???] betray one another [???] although even that [???] make the slight est difference.''if you mean [???]' she said [???]'we shall do that [???] right enough. everybody always confess es. you [???] help it. they torture you.''i [???] mean confess ing. confession is not betray al. what you say or do [???] matter: only feelings matter. if they could make me stop loving [???] would be the real [???]' she thought it over.' they [???] do [???]' she said finally. [???] the one thing they [???] do. they can make you say [???] they [???] make you believe it. they [???] get inside you.' [???]' he said a little more hopeful ly [???]'no; [???] quite true. they [???] get inside you. if you can feel that staying human is worth while [???] even when it [???] have any res ult whatever [???] [???] beaten them.' he thought of the telescreen with its [???] ear. they could spy upon you night and day [???] but if you kept your head you could still out wit them. with all their [???] they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands. one did not know what happened inside the ministry of love [???] but it was possible to guess: tortures [???] drugs [???] delicate instruments that [???] your nervous re actions [???] gradual [???] by [???] and solitude and [???] question ing. facts [???] at any rate [???] could not be kept hidden. they could be track ed down by [???] [???] they could be [???] out of you by torture. but if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human [???] what difference did it ultimately make? they could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself [???] even if you wanted to. they could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart [???] whose workings were mysterious even to yourself [???] remained [???]. chapter 8 they had done it [???] they had done it at last! the room they were standing in was [???] and softly lit. the telescreen was dim med to a low murmur; the richness of the [???] carpet gave one the impression of tread ing on velvet. at the far end of the room [???] was sitting at a table under a [???] lamp [???] with a mass of papers on either side of him. he had not bothered to look up when the servant showed julia and winston in. [???] heart was thump ing so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak. they had done it [???] they had done it at last [???] was all he could think. it had been a rash act to come here at all [???] and sheer folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on [???] doorstep. but merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the ner ve. it was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the [???] of the inner party [???] or even [???] into the quarter of the town where they lived. the whole [???] of the huge block of flats [???] the richness and spaciousness of everything [???] the un familiar smells of good food and good tobacco [???] the silent and [???] rap id lifts sli ding up and down [???] the [???] servants hurry ing to and [???] was [???]. although he had a good pretext for coming here [???] he was haunted at every step by the fear that a [???] guard would suddenly appear from round the corner [???] demand his papers [???] and order him to get out. [???] servant [???] however [???] had admitted the two of them without dem ur. he was a small [???] [???] man in a white jack et [???] with a [???] [???] completely expression less face which might have been that of a chinese. the passage down which he led them was softly carpet ed [???] with [???] walls and white [???] [???] all exquisite ly clean. that too was [???]. winston could not remember ever to have seen a passage way whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies. [???] had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be study ing it intent ly. his heavy face [???] bent down so that one could see the line of the nose [???] looked both [???] and intelligent. for perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring. then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hy brid jar gon of the ministries: [???] one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging cri methink can cel stop unproceed constructionwise ante getting [???] estimates machine ry over heads stop end message.' he rose deliberate ly from his chair and came towards them across the sound less carpet. a little of the official [???] seemed to have fallen away from him with the newspeak words [???] but his expression was grimmer than usual [???] as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. the terror that winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary [???]. it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. for what evidence had he in reality that [???] was any kind of political conspirator? nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single [???] remark: beyond that [???] only his own secret imagin ings [???] found ed on a dream. he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary [???] because in that case [???] presence was impossible to explain. as [???] passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. he stopped [???] turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. there was a sharp sn ap. the voice had stopped. julia uttered a tiny sound [???] a sort of squeak of surprise. even in the midst of his panic [???] winston was too much taken ab ack to be able to hold his tongue.' you can turn it off!' he said. [???]' said [???] [???]'we can turn it off. we have that privilege.' he was opposite them now. his solid form tower ed over the pair of them [???] and the expression on his face was still [???]. he was waiting [???] somewhat stern ly [???] for winston to speak [???] but about what? even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering [???] why he had been interrupted. nobody spoke. after the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. the seconds march ed past [???] enormous. with difficulty winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on [???]. then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile. with his characteristic gesture [???] re settled his spectacles on his nose.' shall i say it [???] or will you?' he said.'i will say [???]' said winston prompt ly.' that thing is really turned off?'' yes [???] everything is turned off. we are alone.''we have come here [???]' he paused [???] realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives. since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from [???] [???] it was not easy to say why he had come here. he went on [???] conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious:'we believe that there is some kind of conspiracy [???] some kind of secret organization working against the party [???] and that you are involved in it. we want to join it and work for it. we are enemies of the party. we dis believe in the principles of ingsoc. we are [???]. we are also adulterers. i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy. if you want us to [???] ourselves in any other way [???] we are ready.' he stopped and glanced over his shoulder [???] with the feeling that the door had opened. sure enough [???] the little [???] servant had come in without knocking. winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a [???] and glasses.' martin is one of [???]' said [???] [???].' bring the drinks over here [???] martin. put them on the round table. have we enough chairs? then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. bring a chair for yourself [???] martin. this is business. you can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes.' the little man sat down [???] quite at his ease [???] and yet still with a [???] air [???] the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. it struck him that the [???] whole life was playing a part [???] and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment. [???] took the [???] by the neck and filled up the glasses with a [???] liquid. it [???] in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a [???] vast bottle compos ed of [???] lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. seen from the top the stuff looked almost black [???] but in the [???] it gleamed like a ruby. it had a [???] smell. he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity.' it is called [???]' said [???] with a faint smile.' you will have read about it in books [???] no doubt. not much of it gets to the outer party [???] i am afraid.' his face grew solemn again [???] and he raised his glass:'i think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. to our leader: to [???] goldstein.' winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. wine was a thing he had read and dream ed about. like the glass paperweight or mr [???] [???] rhymes [???] it belong ed to the vanished [???] rom antic past [???] the old en time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. for some reason he had always thought of wine as having an [???] sweet taste [???] like that of blackberry jam and an immediate [???] effect. actually [???] when he came to swallow it [???] the stuff was distinctly [???]. the truth was that after years of [???] he could barely taste it. he set down the empty glass.' then there is such a person as goldstein?' he said.' yes [???] there is such a person [???] and he is alive. where [???] i do not know.''and the [???] organization? is it real? it is not simply an invention of the thought police?''no [???] it is real. the brotherhood [???] we call it. you will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it. i will come back to that presently.' he looked at his [???].' it is unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour. you ought not to have come here together [???] and you will have to leave separate ly. you [???] [???] bow ed his head to [???] leave first. we have about twenty minutes at our dispos al. you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions. in general terms [???] what are you prepared to do?'' anything that we are capable [???]' said winston. [???] had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was fac ing winston. he almost ignor ed julia [???] seeming to take it for granted that winston could speak for her. for a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes. he began asking his questions in a low [???] expression less voice [???] as though this were a rout ine [???] a sort of [???] [???] most of whose answers were known to him already.' you are prepared to give your lives?' [???]'' you are prepared to commit murder?' [???]''to commit acts of [???] which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people?' [???]''to betray your country to foreign powers?' [???]'' you are prepared to che at [???] to forge [???] to [???] [???] to corrupt the minds of children [???] to distribute [???] drugs [???] to encourage [???] [???] to [???] [???] [???] do anything which is likely to cause [???] and weak en the power of the party?' [???]''if [???] for example [???] it would somehow serve our interests to throw [???] ac id in a [???] [???] you prepared to do that?' [???]'' you are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a [???]' [???]'' you are prepared to commit suicide [???] if and when we order you to do so?' [???]'' you are prepared [???] the two of you [???] to separate and never see one another again?' [???]' broke in julia. it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered. for a moment he seemed even to have been [???] of the power of speech. his tongue worked [???] [???] form ing the opening syllables first of one word [???] then of the other [???] over and over again. until he had said it [???] he did not know which word he was going to say. [???]' he said finally.' you did well to tell [???]' said [???].' it is necessary for us to know everything.' he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it:' do you understand that even if he survives [???] it may be as a different person? we may be obliged to give him a new identity. his face [???] his movements [???] the shape of his hands [???] the colour of his [???] his voice would be different. and you yourself might have become a different person. our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. sometimes it is necessary. sometimes we even [???] a limb.' winston could not help snatch ing another sidelong glance at [???] [???] face. there were no scars that he could see. julia had turned a shade paler [???] so that her [???] were showing [???] but she faced [???] boldly. she murmured something that seemed to be ass ent.' good. then that is settled.' there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. with a rather [???] air [???] pushed them towards the others [???] took one himself [???] then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro [???] as though he could think better standing. they were very good cigarettes [???] very thick and [???] [???] with an un familiar silkiness in the paper. [???] looked at his [???] again.' you had better go back to your pant ry [???] [???]' he said.'i shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. take a good look at these comrades' faces before you go. you will be seeing them again. i may not.' exactly as they had done at the front door [???] the little [???] dark eyes [???] over their faces. there was not a trace of friendliness in his manner. he was memorizing their appearance [???] but he felt no interest in them [???] or appeared to feel none. it occurred to winston that a [???] face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. without speaking or giving any kind of salutation [???] martin went out [???] closing the door silent ly behind him. [???] was strolling up and down [???] one hand in the pocket of his black overalls [???] the other holding his cigarette.' you [???]' he said [???]' that you will be fighting in the dark. you will always be in the dark. you will receive orders and you will obey them [???] without knowing why. later i shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in [???] and the [???] by which we shall destroy it. when you have read the book [???] you will be full members of the brotherhood. but between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment [???] you will never know anything. i tell you that the brotherhood exists [???] but i cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members [???] or ten million. from your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. you will have three or four cont acts [???] who will be renew ed from time to time as they disapp ear. as this was your first contact [???] it will be preserved. when you receive orders [???] they will come from me. if we find it necessary to communic ate with you [???] it will be through martin. when you are finally caught [???] you will confess. that is [???]. but you will have very little to confess [???] other than your own actions. you will not be able to betray more than a hand ful of un important people. probably you will not even betray me. by that time i may be dead [???] or i shall have become a different person [???] with a different face.' he continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. in spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. it came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket [???] or [???] a cigarette. more even than of strength [???] he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. however much in earnest he might be [???] he had nothing of the [???] that belongs to a fanatic. when he spoke of murder [???] suicide [???] [???] disease [???] [???] limbs [???] and altered faces [???] it was with a faint air of [???].' this is [???]' his voice seemed to say;' this is what we have got to do [???] [???]. but this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again.' a wave of admiration [???] almost of worship [???] flow ed out from winston towards [???]. for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of goldstein. when you looked at [???] powerful shoulders and his [???] face [???] so ugly and yet so civilized [???] it was impossible to believe that he could be defeat ed. there was no stratagem that he was not equal to [???] no danger that he could not fores ee. even julia seemed to be impress ed. she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intent ly. [???] went on:' you will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood. no doubt you have formed your own picture of it. you have imagined [???] probably [???] a huge under world of conspirators [???] meeting secretly in cellars [???] [???] messages on walls [???] recognizing one another by [???] or by special movements of the hand. nothing of the kind exists. the members of the brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another [???] and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others. goldstein himself [???] if he fell into the hands of the thought police [???] could not give them a complete list of members [???] or any information that would lead them to a complete list. no such list exists. the brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense. nothing holds it together except an idea which is [???]. you will never have anything to sustain you [???] except the idea. you will get no comrade ship and no encourage ment. when finally you are caught [???] you will get no help. we never help our members. at most [???] when it is absolute ly necessary that someone should be silenced [???] we are occasionally able to [???] a razor blade into a [???] cell. you will have to get used to living without results and without hope. you will work for a while [???] you will be caught [???] you will confess [???] and then you will die. those are the only results that you will ever see. there is no possibility that any [???] change will happen within our own life time. we are the dead. our only true life is in the future. we shall take part in it as [???] of dust and [???] of bone. but how far away that future may be [???] there is no knowing. it might be a thousand years. at present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. we cannot act collectively. we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual [???] generation after generation. in the face of the thought police there is no other way.' he halt ed and looked for the third time at his [???].' it is almost time for you to leave [???] [???]' he said to julia.' wait. the [???] is still half full.' he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.' what shall it be this time?' he said [???] still with the same faint suggestion of irony.'to the confusion of the thought police? to the death of big brother? to humanity? to the future?''to the [???]' said winston.'the past is more [???]' agreed [???] grave ly. they emptied their glasses [???] and a moment later julia stood up to go. [???] took a small box from the top of a cabin et and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. it was important [???] he said [???] not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observ ant. as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence. he took another pace or two up and down [???] then stopped.' there are details to be [???]' he said.'i assume that you have a [???] of some kind?' winston explain ed about the room over mr [???] shop.' that will do for the moment. later we will arrange something else for you. it is important to change [???] [???] [???]. meanwhile i shall send you a copy of the [???] [???] [???] winston noticed [???] seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in [???] book [???] you understand [???] as soon as possible. it may be some days before i can get hold of one. there are not many in existence [???] as you can imagine. the thought police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them. it makes very little difference. the book is [???]. if the last copy were gone [???] we could re produce it almost word for word. do you carry a [???] to work with you?' he added.' as a rule [???] yes.'' what is it like?'' black [???] very [???]. with two [???]'' black [???] two straps [???] very [???]. one day in the fairly near [???] cannot give a [???] of the messages among your [???] work will contain a misprinted word [???] and you will have to ask for a repeat. on the following day you will go to work without your [???]. at some time during the day [???] in the street [???] a man will touch you on the arm and say [???] think you have dropped your [???] [???] the one he gives you will contain a copy of [???] book. you will return it within fourteen days.' they were silent for a moment.' there are a couple of minutes before you need [???]' said [???].'we shall meet [???] we do meet [???]' winston looked up at him.' in the place where there is no darkness?' he said [???]. [???] nodded without appearance of surprise.' in the place where there is no [???]' he said [???] as though he had recognized the allusion.'and in the meantime [???] is there anything that you wish to say before you leave? any message? any [???]' winston thought. there did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter [???] generalities. instead of anything directly connected with [???] or the brotherhood [???] there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days [???] and the little room over mr [???] shop [???] and the glass paperweight [???] and the steel [???] in its rose wood frame. almost at ran dom he said:' did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???]' again [???] nodded. with a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza: [???] and le mons [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] you owe me three farthings [???] say the bells of st [???] [???] when will you pay me? say the bells of old bailey [???] when i grow rich [???] say the bells of [???]'' you knew the last line!' said winston.' yes [???] i knew the last line. and now [???] i am afraid [???] it is time for you to go. but wait. you had better let me give you one of these [???]' as winston stood up [???] held out a hand. his powerful grip crush ed the bones of [???] palm. at the door winston looked back [???] but [???] seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. he was waiting with his hand on the switch that control led the telescreen. beyond him winston could see the [???] with its [???] lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets [???] with papers. the inc ident was closed. within thirty seconds [???] it occurred to him [???] [???] would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the party. chapter 9 winston was [???] with [???]. [???] was the right word. it had come into his head [???]. his body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly [???] but its [???]. he felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it. all the blood and [???] had been drained out of him by an enormous [???] of work [???] leaving only a frail structure of ner ves [???] bones [???] and skin. all sensations seemed to be magnified. his overalls fret ted his shoulders [???] the pavement tick led his feet [???] even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak. he had worked more than ninety hours in five days. so had everyone else in the ministry. now it was all over [???] and he had literally nothing to do [???] no party work of any description [???] until tomorrow morning. he could spend six hours in the [???] and another nine in his own bed. slowly [???] in mild afternoon sunshine [???] he walked up a dingy street in the direction of mr [???] shop [???] keeping one eye open for the patrols [???] but [???] convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone [???] with him. the heavy [???] that he was carrying [???] against his knee at each step [???] sending a [???] sensation up and down the skin of his leg. inside it was the book [???] which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened [???] nor even looked at. on the sixth day of hate week [???] after the processions [???] the speeches [???] the shouting [???] the singing [???] the banners [???] the posters [???] the films [???] the wax works [???] the rolling of drums and [???] of trumpets [???] the tramp of marching feet [???] the grind ing of the [???] of tanks [???] the roar of mas sed plan es [???] the [???] of [???] six days of this [???] when the great orgasm was [???] to its clim ax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such [???] that if the crowd could have got their hands on the [???] eurasian [???] who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings [???] they would [???] have torn them to [???] just this moment it had been announced that oceania was not after all at war with eurasia. oceania was at war with eastasia. eurasia was an al ly. there was [???] of course [???] no admission that any change had taken place. merely it became known [???] with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once [???] that eastasia and not eurasia was the enemy. winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when it happened. it was night [???] and the white faces and the scarlet banners were lur idly flood lit. the square was pack ed with several thousand people [???] including a block of about a thousand school children in the uniform of the spies. on a [???] platform an orator of the inner party [???] a small lean man with [???] long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks [???] [???] was [???] the crowd. a little [???] figure [???] contorted with hatred [???] he gripped the neck of the [???] with one hand while the other [???] enormous at the end of a bony arm [???] [???] the air [???] above his head. his voice [???] made metal lic by the [???] [???] boomed forth an endless [???] of [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] rap ings [???] torture of prisoners [???] bomb ing of civilians [???] lying [???] [???] unjust [???] [???] broken treaties. it was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then [???]. at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild [???] roaring that rose [???] from thousands of throats. the most savage yells of all came from the school children. the speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the [???] hand. he unrolled and read it without pa using in his speech. nothing altered in his voice or manner [???] or in the content of what he was saying [???] but suddenly the names were different. without words said [???] a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd. oceania was at war with eastasia! the next moment there was a tremendous commotion. the banners and posters with which the square was [???] were all wrong! quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. it was [???]! the agents of goldstein had been at work! there was a riotous [???] while posters were ripped from the walls [???] banners torn to shreds and tramp led underfoot. the spies performed prodigies of activity in [???] over the roof tops and cutting the streamers that fl uttered from the chimneys. but within two or three minutes it was all over. the orator [???] still gripping the neck of the [???] [???] his shoulders hunched forward [???] his free hand [???] at the air [???] had gone straight on with his speech. one minute more [???] and the fer al roars of rage were again burst ing from the crowd. the hate continued exactly as before [???] except that the target had been changed. the thing that impress ed winston in looking back was that the speaker had [???] from one line to the other actually in mid sentence [???] not only without a pause [???] but without even breaking the [???]. but at the moment he had other things to [???] him. it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said [???]' excuse me [???] i think [???] dropped your [???]' he took the [???] [???] [???] without speaking. he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it. the instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the ministry of truth [???] though the time was now nearly [???] hours. the entire staff of the ministry had done likewise. the orders already issu ing from the telescreen [???] recall ing them to their posts [???] were hardly necessary. oceania was at war with eastasia: oceania had always been at war with eastasia. a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely [???]. reports and records of all kinds [???] newspapers [???] books [???] [???] [???] films [???] [???] [???] [???] had to be rectified at lightning speed. although no directive was ever issu ed [???] it was known that the chiefs of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia [???] or the alliance with eastasia [???] should remain in existence anywhere. the work was overwhel ming [???] all the more so because the process es that it involved could not be called by their true names. everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in the [???] [???] with two [???] snatch es of sleep. [???] were brought up from the cellars and pitch ed all over the corridors: meals consisted of [???] and victory coffee wheel ed round on [???] by attendants from the canteen. each time that winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work [???] and each time that he [???] back [???] and ach ing [???] it was to find that another sho wer of paper [???] had covered the desk like a snow drift [???] [???] the speakwrite and over flowing on to the floor [???] so that the first job was always to st ack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work. what was worst of all was that the work was by no means pure ly mechanical. often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another [???] but any detail ed report of events demanded care and imagination. even the [???] knowledge that one needed in [???] the war from one part of the world to another was consider able. by the third day his eyes ached [???] and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes. it was like strugg ling with some crush ing physical task [???] something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless [???] anxious to accomplish. in so far as he had time to remember it [???] he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite [???] every stroke of his [???] [???] was a deliberate lie. he was as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forge ry should be perfect. on the morning of the sixth day the [???] of [???] slow ed down. for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one more [???] [???] then nothing. everywhere at about the same time the work was eas ing off. a deep and as it were secret sigh went through the department. a mighty deed [???] which could never be mentioned [???] had been achieved. it was now impossible for any human being to prove by [???] evidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened. at twelve hundred it was [???] announced that all workers in the ministry were free till tomorrow morning. winston [???] still carrying the [???] containing the book [???] which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept [???] went home [???] shaved himself [???] and almost fell asleep in his bath [???] although the water was barely more than tepid. with a sort of [???] creaking in his joints he climb ed the stair above mr [???] shop. he was tired [???] but not sleepy any longer. he opened the window [???] lit the dirty little [???] and put on a pan of water for coffee. julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. he sat down in the [???] arm chair and und id the straps of the [???]. a heavy black volume [???] [???] bound [???] with no name or title on the cover. the print also looked slightly ir regular. the pages were worn at the edges [???] and fell apart [???] easily [???] as though the book had passed through many hands. the [???] on the [???] ran: the theory and practice of [???] [???] by [???] goldstein winston began reading: chapter i ignorance is strength throughout record ed time [???] and probably since the end of the [???] age [???] there have been three kinds of people in the world [???] the high [???] the middle [???] and the low. they have been sub divided in many ways [???] they have borne count less different names [???] and their relative numbers [???] as well as their attitude towards one another [???] have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. even after enormous [???] and seeming ly [???] changes [???] the same pattern has always [???] itself [???] just as a [???] will always return to [???] [???] however far it is pushed one way or the other. the aims of these groups are entirely [???]. winston stopped reading [???] chiefly in order to [???] the fact that he was reading [???] in comfort and safety. he was alone: no telescreen [???] no ear at the key hole [???] no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand. the sweet summer air played against his cheek. from somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. he settled deeper into the [???] and put his feet up on the fender. it was bliss [???] it was eternity. suddenly [???] as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and [???] every word [???] he opened it at a different place and found himself at chapter iii. he went on reading: chapter iii war is peace the splitting up of the world into three great [???] was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. with the [???] of europe by russia and of the british empire by the uni ted states [???] two of the three exist ing powers [???] eurasia and oceania [???] were already effectively in being. the third [???] eastasia [???] only [???] as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. the frontiers between the three [???] are in some places [???] [???] and in others they [???] according to the fortunes of war [???] but in general they follow [???] lines. eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the europe an and [???] [???] [???] from [???] to the ber ing strait. oceania comprises the [???] [???] the [???] islands including the british isles [???] [???] [???] and the southern portion of africa. eastasia [???] small er than the others and with a less definite western frontier [???] comprises china and the countries to the south of it [???] the [???] islands and a large but [???] portion of [???] [???] [???] [???] and ti bet. in one combination or another [???] these three [???] are permanently at war [???] and have been so for the past [???] years. war [???] however [???] is no longer the desperate [???] [???] struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century. it is a war fare of limit ed aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another [???] have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any [???] ideological difference. this is not to say that either the conduct of war [???] or the prevail ing attitude towards it [???] has become less [???] or more chival rous. on the contrary [???] war [???] is continuous and universal in all countries [???] and such acts as rap ing [???] looting [???] the slaughter of children [???] the reduction of whole [???] to slavery [???] and [???] against prisoners which extend even to boiling and bury ing alive [???] are looked upon as normal [???] and [???] when they are committed by [???] own side and not by the enemy [???] meritorious. but in a physical sense war invol ves very small numbers of people [???] most ly [???] specialists [???] and causes [???] few [???]. the fighting [???] when there is any [???] takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the ave rage man can only guess at [???] or round the floating fortress es which guard [???] spots on the sea lan es. in the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous short age of consumption goods [???] and the occasion al crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. war has in fact changed its character. more exactly [???] the reasons for which war is wag ed have changed in their order of importance. motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become domin ant and are conscious ly recognized and acted upon. to understand the nature of the present [???] in spite of the [???] which occurs every few years [???] it is always the same [???] must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be [???]. none of the three [???] could be [???] conquered even by the other two in combination. they are too even ly matched [???] and their natural defences are too [???]. eurasia is protect ed by its vast land spaces [???] oceania by the width of the [???] and the [???] [???] eastasia by the [???] and [???] of its inhabitants. second ly [???] there is no longer [???] in a material sense [???] anything to fight about. with the establish ment of [???] [???] [???] in which production and consumption are geared to one another [???] the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end [???] while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. in any case each of the three [???] is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose [???] it is a war for labour power. between the frontiers of the [???] [???] and not permanently in the possession of any of them [???] there lies a rough [???] with its corners at [???] [???] [???] [???] dar win [???] and hong kong [???] containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth. it is for the possession of these [???] regions [???] and of the northern [???] [???] that the three powers are constantly strugg ling. in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area. portions of it are constantly changing hands [???] and it is the chance of seiz ing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that [???] the endless changes of [???]. all of the disputed territories contain [???] [???] [???] and some of them yield important [???] [???] such as rubb er which in col der climates it is necessary to [???] by [???] expensive methods. but above all they contain a bottom less reserve of cheap labour. whichever power controls [???] africa [???] or the countries of the middle east [???] or southern india [???] or the [???] [???] [???] disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of [???] and [???] coolies. the inhabitants of these ar eas [???] reduced more or less openly to the stat us of slaves [???] pass continual ly from conqueror to conqueror [???] and are exp ended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments [???] to capture more territory [???] to control more labour power [???] to turn out more armaments [???] to capture more territory [???] and so on [???]. it should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed ar eas. the frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congo and the northern shore of the [???]; the islands of the indian ocean and the [???] are constantly being captured and [???] by oceania or by eastasia; in [???] the dividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stab le; round the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are large ly [???] and [???]: but the balance of power always remains rough ly even [???] and the territory which forms the heart land of each [???] always remains [???]. moreover [???] the labour of the exploit ed peoples round the equator is not really necessary to the [???] economy. they add nothing to the wealth of the world [???] since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war [???] and the object of wag ing a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war. by their labour the slave [???] allow the tempo of continuous war fare to be spee ded up. but if they did not exist [???] the structure of world society [???] and the process by which it maintains itself [???] would not be essentially different. the primary aim of modern war fare( in accordance with the principles of doublethink [???] this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the direct ing brains of the inner party) is to use up the [???] of the machine without raising the general standard of living. ever since the end of the nineteenth century [???] the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been lat ent in industri al society. at present [???] when few human beings even have enough to eat [???] this problem is obviously not urg ent [???] and it might not have become so [???] even if no artificial process es of destruction had been at work. the world of today is a bare [???] hungry [???] [???] place compared with the world that existed before 19 14 [???] and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward. in the early twentieth century [???] the vision of a future society [???] rich [???] leisured [???] order ly [???] and [???] glittering [???] world of glass and steel and [???] [???] part of the consciousness of nearly every liter ate person. science and [???] were develop ing at a prodigious speed [???] and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on develop ing. this failed to happen [???] partly because of the [???] caused by a long series of wars and revolutions [???] partly because [???] and technical progress depend ed on the [???] habit of thought [???] which could not survive in a strict ly [???] society. as a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago. certain backward ar eas have advanced [???] and various devices [???] always in some way connected with war fare and police [???] [???] have been develop ed [???] but experiment and invention have large ly stopped [???] and the rav ages of the atomic war of the [???] have never been fully repair ed. nevertheless the dangers inher ent in the machine are still there. from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human [???] [???] and therefore to a great extent for human ine quality [???] had disappeared. if the machine were used deliberate ly for that end [???] hunger [???] overwork [???] dirt [???] [???] [???] and disease could be [???] within a few generations. and in fact [???] without being used for any such purpose [???] but by a sort of [???] [???] producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to [???] machine did raise the living standards of the ave rage human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth [???]. but it was also clear that an [???] increase in wealth threaten ed the [???] [???] in some sense was the [???] a [???] society. in a world in which everyone worked short hours [???] had enough to eat [???] lived in a house with a bathroom and a [???] [???] and possessed a [???] or even an [???] [???] the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of ine quality would already have disappeared. if it once became general [???] wealth would confer no distinction. it was possible [???] no doubt [???] to imagine a society in which wealth [???] in the sense of personal possessions and [???] [???] should be even ly distributed [???] while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. but in practice such a society could not long remain stab le. for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike [???] the great mass of human beings who are normal ly [???] by poverty would become liter ate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this [???] they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function [???] and they would sweep it away. in the long run [???] a [???] society was only possible on a bas is of poverty and ignorance. to return to the [???] past [???] as some thinke rs about the beginning of the twentieth century dream ed of doing [???] was not a [???] solution. it conflict ed with the tendency towards mechanization which had become [???] throughout almost the whole world [???] and moreover [???] any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated [???] directly or indirectly [???] by its more advanced rivals. nor was it a [???] solution to keep the masses in poverty by [???] the out put of goods. this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism [???] rough ly between [???] and [???]. the economy of many countries was allowed to [???] [???] land went out of [???] [???] capital [???] was not added to [???] great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity. but this [???] too [???] [???] military weakness [???] and since the privations it [???] were obviously unnecessary [???] it made opposition [???]. the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. goods must be produced [???] but they must not be distributed. and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous war fare. the essential act of war is destruction [???] not necessarily of human lives [???] but of the [???] of human labour. war is a way of [???] to pieces [???] or pour ing into the stratosphere [???] or sinking in the depths of the sea [???] materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable [???] and hence [???] in the long run [???] too intelligent. even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed [???] their [???] is still a convenient way of exp ending labour power without producing anything that can be consum ed. a floating fortress [???] for example [???] has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred [???]. ultimately it is scrapped as [???] [???] never having brought any material benefit to anybody [???] and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is built. in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. in practice the needs of the population are always [???] [???] with the res ult that there is a chronic short age of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the br ink of hard ship [???] because a general state of scar city increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. by the standards of the early twentieth century [???] even a member of the inner party lives an aust ere [???] [???] kind of life. nevertheless [???] the few [???] that he does enjoy his large [???] [???] flat [???] the better texture of his clothes [???] the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco [???] his two or three servants [???] his private [???] or [???] him in a different world from a member of the outer party [???] and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the [???] masses whom we call'the proles'. the social [???] is that of a [???] city [???] where the possession of a lump of horse flesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. and at the same time the consciousness of being at war [???] and therefore in danger [???] makes the [???] of all power to a small caste seem the natural [???] [???] condition of survival. war [???] it will be seen [???] accomplish es the necessary destruction [???] but accomplish es it in a [???] accept able way. in principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids [???] by digging holes and filling them up again [???] or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. but this would provide only the economic and not the emotion al bas is for a [???] society. what is concerned here is not the morale of masses [???] whose attitude is un important so long as they are kept steadily at work [???] but the morale of the party itself. even the humblest party member is expected to be compet ent [???] industrious [???] and even intelligent within narrow limits [???] but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevail ing moods are fear [???] hatred [???] adulation [???] and [???] triumph. in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality [???] to a state of war. it does not matter whether the war is actually happening [???] and [???] since no [???] victory is possible [???] it does not matter whether the war is going well or bad ly. all that is needed is that a state of war should exist. the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members [???] and which is more easily achieved in an [???] of war [???] is now almost universal [???] but the higher up the ranks one goes [???] the more marked it becomes. it is precise ly in the inner party that war [???] and hatred of the enemy are strongest. in his capacity as an [???] [???] it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is [???] [???] and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being wag ed for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily [???] by the [???] of doublethink. meanwhile no inner party member wave rs for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real [???] and that it is bound to end victorious ly [???] with oceania the [???] master of the entire world. all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith. it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhel ming [???] of power [???] or by the discovery of some new and [???] weapon. the search for new weapons continues [???] [???] and is one of the very few remaining [???] in which the inventive or speculative ty pe of mind can find any outlet. in oceania at the present day [???] science [???] in the old sense [???] has almost ceased to exist. in newspeak there is no word for [???]. the [???] method of thought [???] on which all the [???] achievements of the past were found ed [???] is opposed to the most [???] principles of ingsoc. and even [???] progress only happens when its [???] can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. in all the use ful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. the fields are [???] with [???] while books are written by machine ry. but in matters of vi tal [???] [???] in effect [???] war and police [???] [???] approach is still encouraged [???] or at least tolerated. the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to [???] once and for all the possibility of [???] thought. there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to sol ve. one is how to discover [???] against his will [???] what another human being is thinking [???] and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. in so far as [???] re search still continues [???] this is its subject matter. the [???] of today is either a mixture of [???] and [???] [???] study ing with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions [???] gestures [???] and tones of voice [???] and test ing the [???] effects of drugs [???] shock [???] [???] [???] [???] and physical torture; or he is che mist [???] physicist [???] or [???] concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are [???] to the taking of life. in the vast [???] of the ministry of peace [???] and in the [???] stations hidden in the [???] forests [???] or in the [???] desert [???] or on lost islands of the [???] [???] the teams of experts are [???] at work. some are concerned simply with plan ning the [???] of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs [???] more and more powerful [???] [???] and more and more [???] [???]; others search for new and deadlier gases [???] or for [???] poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the [???] of whole continents [???] or for breeds of disease germs [???] against all possible anti bodies; others strive to produce a [???] that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water [???] or an [???] as [???] of its base as a [???]; others explo re even remoter [???] such as [???] the [???] rays through lenses [???] thousands of [???] away in space [???] or producing artificial [???] and tid al waves by tapping the heat at the [???] centre. but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization [???] and none of the three [???] ever gains a [???] lead on the others. what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess [???] in the atomic bomb [???] a weapon far more powerful than any that their present [???] are likely to discover. although the party [???] according to its habit [???] claims the invention for itself [???] atomic bombs first appeared as early as the [???] [???] and were first used on a large scale about ten years later. at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industri al centres [???] chiefly in europe an russia [???] western europe [???] and north [???]. the effect was to convin ce the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society [???] and hence of their own power. thereafter [???] although no formal agree ment was ever made or hinted at [???] no more bombs were dropped. all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the [???] opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later. and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years. helicopters are more used than they were former ly [???] bomb ing plan es have been large ly [???] by [???] projectiles [???] and the frag ile mov able battleship has given way to the almost [???] floating fortress; but otherwise there has been little develop ment. the t ank [???] the submarine [???] the [???] [???] the machine gun [???] even the ri fle and the hand [???] are still in use. and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens [???] the desperate battles of earlier wars [???] in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks [???] have never been repeated. none of the three [???] ever attempts any [???] which invol ves the risk of serious defeat. when any large ope ration is undertaken [???] it is usually a surprise attack against an al ly. the [???] that all three powers are following [???] or pretend to themselves that they are following [???] is the same. the plan is [???] by a combination of fighting [???] bargain ing [???] and [???] strokes of treachery [???] to acqu ire a ring of bases completely [???] one or other of the rival states [???] and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep. during this time rockets load ed with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the [???] spots; finally they will all be fi red simultaneously [???] with effects so [???] as to make [???] impossible. it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining [???] [???] in preparation for another attack. this [???] [???] it is hardly necessary to say [???] is a mere day dream [???] impossible of realization. moreover [???] no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed ar eas round the equator and the pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken. this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the [???] are [???]. eurasia [???] for example [???] could easily conquer the british isles [???] which are [???] part of europe [???] or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rh ine or even to the [???]. but this would vio late the principle [???] followed on all sides though never formulated [???] of [???] integrity. if oceania were to conquer the ar eas that used once to be known as france and ger many [???] it would be necessary either to [???] the inhabitants [???] a task of great physical difficulty [???] or to [???] a population of about a hundred million people [???] who [???] so far as technical develop ment goes [???] are rough ly on the oceanic level. the problem is the same for all three [???]. it is absolute ly necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners [???] except [???] to a limit ed extent [???] with war prisoners and coloured slaves. even the official al ly of the moment is always regarded with the dark est suspicion. war prisoners apart [???] the ave rage citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia [???] and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. the seal ed world in which he lives would be broken [???] and the fear [???] hatred [???] and [???] on which his morale depends might [???]. it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia [???] or egypt [???] or ja va [???] or [???] may change hands [???] the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs. under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud [???] but [???] understood and acted upon: nam ely [???] that the conditions of life in all three [???] are very much the same. in oceania the prevail ing philosophy is called ingsoc [???] in eurasia it is called [???] [???] and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as [???] [???] but perhaps better rendered as [???] of the self. the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies [???] but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outr ages upon morality and common sense. actually the three philosophies are barely distinguish able [???] and the social systems which they support are not distinguish able at all. everywhere there is the same [???] structure [???] the same worship of [???] leader [???] the same economy exist ing by and for continuous war fare. it follows that the three [???] not only cannot conquer one another [???] but would gain no advantage by doing so. on the contrary [???] so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up [???] like three sheaves of corn. and [???] as usual [???] the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and un aware of what they are doing. their lives are dedicated to world conquest [???] but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlasting ly and without victory. meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier [???] that by becoming continuous war has [???] changed its character. in past ages [???] a war [???] almost by [???] [???] was something that sooner or later came to an end [???] usually in [???] victory or defeat. in the past [???] also [???] war was one of the main instruments by which human [???] were kept in touch with physical reality. all rule rs in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers [???] but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tend ed to imp air military efficiency. so long as defeat meant the loss of [???] [???] or some other res ult generally held to be [???] [???] the [???] against defeat had to be serious. physical facts could not be ignor ed. in philosophy [???] or religion [???] or [???] [???] or politics [???] two and two might make five [???] but when one was design ing a gun or an [???] they had to make four. [???] nations were always conquered sooner or later [???] and the struggle for efficiency was [???] to [???]. moreover [???] to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past [???] which meant having a fairly accur ate idea of what had happened in the past. newspapers and history books were [???] of course [???] always coloured and bias ed [???] but falsification of the kind that is practis ed today would have been impossible. war was a sure safe guard of sanity [???] and so far as the ruling class es were concerned it was probably the most important of all safe guards. while wars could be won or lost [???] no ruling class could be completely [???]. but when war becomes literally continuous [???] it also ceases to be dangerous. when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity. technical progress can cease and the most [???] facts can be denied or dis regarded. as we have seen [???] [???] that could be called [???] are still carried out for the purposes of war [???] but they are essentially a kind of [???] [???] and their failure to show results is not important. efficiency [???] even military efficiency [???] is no longer needed. nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police. since each of the three [???] is [???] [???] each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any [???] of thought can be safely practis ed. reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday [???] need to eat and drink [???] to get shelter and clo thing [???] to avoid swallow ing poison or stepping out of [???] windows [???] and the like. between life and death [???] and between physical pleasure and physical pain [???] there is still a distinction [???] but that is all. cut off from contact with the outer world [???] and with the past [???] the citizen of oceania is like a man in [???] space [???] who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down. the rule rs of such a state are absolute [???] as the [???] or the caesars could not be. they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be in convenient [???] and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military [???] as their rivals; but once that [???] is achieved [???] they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose. the war [???] therefore [???] if we judge it by the standards of previous wars [???] is merely an imposture. it is like the battles between certain [???] animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurt ing one another. but though it is unre al it is not meaning less. it eats up the surplus of consum able goods [???] and it helps to preserve the special mental [???] that a [???] society needs. war [???] it will be seen [???] is now a pure ly [???] affair. in the past [???] the ruling groups of all countries [???] although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the [???] of war [???] did fight against one another [???] and the victor always [???] the vanquish ed. in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. the war is wag ed by each ruling group against its own subjects [???] and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory [???] but to keep the structure of society intact. the very word [???] [???] therefore [???] has become mis leading. it would probably be accur ate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. the peculiar pressure that it exer ted on human beings between the [???] age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. the effect would be much the same if the three [???] [???] instead of fighting one another [???] should agree to live in perpetual peace [???] each [???] within its own boundaries. for in that case each would still be a [???] universe [???] fre ed for ever from the sober ing influence of external danger. a peace that was truly perman ent would be the same as a perman ent war. [???] the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallow er [???] the inner meaning of the party slog an: war is peace. winston stopped reading for a moment. somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thunder ed. the bliss ful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book [???] in a room with no telescreen [???] had not worn off. solitude and safety were physical sensations [???] mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body [???] the softness of the chair [???] the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. the book [???] him [???] or more exactly it re assured him. in a sense it told him nothing that was new [???] but that was part of the attraction. it said what he would have said [???] if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. it was the product of a mind similar to his own [???] but enormous ly more powerful [???] more systematic [???] less [???]. the best books [???] he perceived [???] are those that tell you what you know already. he had just turned back to chapter i when he heard [???] footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her. she dumped her brown [???] on the floor and flung herself into his arms. it was more than a week since they had seen one another. [???] got the [???]' he said as they [???] themselves.' oh [???] [???] got it? [???]' she said without much interest [???] and almost immediately kne lt down beside the oil sto ve to make the coffee. they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour. the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the [???]. from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scra pe of boots on the flag stones. the brawny [???] woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the wash tub and the line [???] [???] gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. he reached out for the book [???] which was lying on the floor [???] and sat up against the bedhead.'we must read [???]' he said.' you too. all members of the brotherhood have to read it.'' you read [???]' she said with her eyes shut.'read it aloud. [???] the best way. then you can explain it to me as you go.' the [???] hands said six [???] meaning eighteen. they had three or four hours ahead of them. he propped the book against his knees and began reading: chapter i ignorance is strength throughout record ed time [???] and probably since the end of the [???] age [???] there have been three kinds of people in the world [???] the high [???] the middle [???] and the low. they have been sub divided in many ways [???] they have borne count less different names [???] and their relative numbers [???] as well as their attitude towards one another [???] have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. even after enormous [???] and seeming ly [???] changes [???] the same pattern has always [???] itself [???] just as a [???] will always return to [???] [???] however far it is pushed one way or the other' julia [???] are you awake?' said winston.' yes [???] my love [???] [???] listening. go on. [???] marvellous.' he continued reading: the aims of these three groups are entirely [???]. the aim of the high is to remain where they are. the aim of the middle is to change places with the high. the aim of the low [???] when they have an [???] it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crush ed by [???] to be more than [???] conscious of anything outside their daily [???] to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines rec urs over and over again. for long periods the high seem to be secure ly in power [???] but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern [???] [???] or both. they are then overthrown by the middle [???] who enlist the low on their side by pretend ing to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. as soon as they have reached their objective [???] the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude [???] and themselves become the high. presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups [???] or from both of them [???] and the struggle begins over again. of the three groups [???] only the low are never even temporarily success ful in achieving their aims. it would be an [???] to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. even today [???] in a period of decline [???] the ave rage human being is physical ly better off than he was a few [???] ago. but no advance in wealth [???] no softening of manners [???] no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a [???] nearer. from the point of view of the low [???] no [???] change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters. by the late nineteenth century the [???] of this pattern had become obvious to many observe rs. there then rose schools of thinke rs who interpre ted history as a [???] process and claim ed to show that ine quality was the [???] law of human life. this doctrine [???] of course [???] had always had its [???] [???] but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a [???] change. in the past the need for a [???] form of society had been the doctrine [???] of the high. it had been preached by kings and [???] and by the priests [???] lawyers [???] and the like who were [???] upon them [???] and it had generally been softened by promises of [???] in an imaginary world beyond the grave. the middle [???] so long as it was strugg ling for power [???] had always made use of such terms as freedom [???] justice [???] and [???]. now [???] however [???] the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command [???] but merely hoped to be so before long. in the past the middle had made revolutions under the ban ner of equality [???] and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. the new middle groups in effect proclaim ed their tyranny beforehand. socialism [???] a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretch ing back to the slave rebel lions of antiquity [???] was still deeply infected by the [???] of past ages. but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establish ing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandon ed. the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century [???] ingsoc in oceania [???] [???] in eurasia [???] [???] [???] as it is common ly called [???] in eastasia [???] had the conscious aim of [???] un freedom and ine quality. these new movements [???] of course [???] grew out of the old ones and tend ed to keep their names and pay [???] to their ideology. but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment. the familiar [???] swing was to happen once more [???] and then stop. as usual [???] the high were to be turned out by the middle [???] who would then become the high; but this time [???] by conscious [???] [???] the high would be able to maintain their position permanently. the new doctrines arose partly because of the [???] of [???] knowledge [???] and the growth of the [???] sense [???] which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century. the [???] movement of history was now intelligible [???] or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible [???] then it was alter able. but the principal [???] under lying cause was that [???] as early as the beginning of the twentieth century [???] human equality had become technically possible. it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. in earlier ages [???] class distinctions had been not only [???] but desir able. ine quality was the price of civilization. with the develop ment of machine production [???] however [???] the case was altered. even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work [???] it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels. therefore [???] from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seiz ing power [???] human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after [???] but a danger to be averted. in more primitive ages [???] when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible [???] it had been fairly easy to believe it. the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood [???] without laws and without brute labour [???] had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profit ed by each [???] change. the heirs of the french [???] english [???] and [???] revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man [???] freedom of speech [???] equality before the law [???] and the like [???] and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent. but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were [???]. the earthly paradise had been [???] at exactly the moment when it became [???]. every new political theory [???] by whatever name it called itself [???] led back to [???] and [???]. and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about [???] [???] practices which had been long abandon ed [???] in some cases for hundreds of [???] without trial [???] the use of war prisoners as slaves [???] public executions [???] torture to extract confessions [???] the use of host ages [???] and the [???] of whole [???] only became common again [???] but were tolerated and even defend ed by people who considered themselves [???] and progressive. it was only after a decade of nation al wars [???] civil wars [???] revolutions [???] and [???] in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals [???] as fully [???] political theories. but they had been [???] by the various systems [???] generally called [???] [???] which had appeared earlier in the century [???] and the main outlines of the world which would [???] from the prevail ing cha os had long been obvious. what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. the new [???] was made up for the most part of [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] publicity experts [???] [???] [???] teachers [???] [???] [???] and profession al politicians. these people [???] whose orig ins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grad es of the working class [???] had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of [???] industry and [???] government. as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages [???] they were less [???] [???] less tempted by luxury [???] hungrier for pure power [???] and [???] above all [???] more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crush ing opposition. this last difference was cardinal. by comparison with that exist ing today [???] all the tyrannies of the past were [???] and [???]. the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas [???] and were content to leave loose ends everywhere [???] to regard only the overt act and to be un interested in what their subjects were thinking. even the [???] church of the middle ages was toler ant by modern standards. part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant [???]. the invention of print [???] however [???] made it easier to [???] public opinion [???] and the film and the radio carried the process further. with the develop ment of [???] [???] and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument [???] private life came to an end. every citizen [???] or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching [???] could be kept for [???] hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official [???] [???] with all other channels of communication closed. the possibility of enforc ing not only complete obedience to the will of the state [???] but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects [???] now existed for the first time. after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties [???] society [???] itself [???] as always [???] into high [???] middle [???] and low. but the new high group [???] unlike all its [???] [???] did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safe guard its position. it had long been realized that the only secure bas is for [???] is [???]. wealth and privilege are most easily defend ed when they are possessed joint ly. the [???] [???] of private property' which took place in the middle years of the century meant [???] in effect [???] the [???] of property in far few er hands than before: but with this difference [???] that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals. individual ly [???] no member of the party owns anything [???] except petty personal belongings. collectively [???] the party owns everything in oceania [???] because it controls everything [???] and disposes of the [???] as it thinks fit. in the years following the revolution it was able to step into this command ing position almost un opposed [???] because the whole process was represent ed as an act of [???]. it had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were [???] [???] socialism must follow: and [???] the capitalists had been [???]. factories [???] min es [???] land [???] houses [???] [???] had been taken away from them: and since these things were no longer private property [???] it followed that they must be public property. ingsoc [???] which grew out of the earlier socialist movement and inherit ed its [???] [???] has in fact carried out the main item in the socialist [???]; with the res ult [???] foreseen and intended beforehand [???] that economic ine quality has been made perman ent. but the problems of [???] a [???] society go deeper than this. there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. either it is conquered from without [???] or it governs so [???] that the masses are stirred to revolt [???] or it allows a strong and discontented middle group to come into being [???] or it los es its own [???] and willingness to govern. these causes do not operate sing ly [???] and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. ultimately the determin ing fac tor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself. after the middle of the present century [???] the first danger had in reality disappeared. each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact [???] [???] and could only become conquer able through slow [???] changes which a government with wide powers can easily ave rt. the second danger [???] also [???] is only a [???] one. the masses never revolt of their own accord [???] and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. indeed [???] so long as they are not permit ted to have standards of comparison [???] they never even become aware that they are oppressed. the re current economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permit ted to happen [???] but other and equally large [???] can and do happen without having political results [???] because there is no way in which discontent can become [???]. as for the problem of [???] [???] which has been lat ent in our society since the develop ment of machine [???] [???] it is solved by the device of continuous war fare( see chapter iii) [???] which is also use ful in key ing up public morale to the necessary pitch. from the point of view of our present rule rs [???] therefore [???] the only [???] dangers are the [???] of a new group of able [???] [???] [???] [???] people [???] and the growth of liberalism and [???] in their own ranks. the problem [???] that is to say [???] is education al. it is a problem of continuously mould ing the consciousness both of the direct ing group and of the larger [???] group that lies immediately below it. the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way. given this background [???] one could infer [???] if one did not know it already [???] the general structure of oceanic society. at the apex of the pyram id comes big brother. big brother is infallible and [???]. every success [???] every achieve ment [???] every victory [???] every [???] discovery [???] all knowledge [???] all wisdom [???] all happiness [???] all virtue [???] are held to issue directly from his leader ship and [???]. nobody has ever seen big brother. he is a face on the [???] [???] a voice on the telescreen. we may be reasonably sure that he will never die [???] and there is already consider able uncertain ty as to when he was born. big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhib it itself to the world. his function is to act as a [???] point for love [???] fear [???] and reverence [???] emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization. below big brother comes the inner party. its numbers limit ed to six millions [???] or something less than 2 per cent of the population of oceania. below the inner party comes the outer party [???] which [???] if the inner party is described as the brain of the state [???] may be justly likened to the hands. below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as'the proles' [???] numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. in the terms of our earlier classification [???] the proles are the low: for the slave population of the [???] lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror [???] are not a perman ent or necessary part of the structure. in principle [???] membership of these three groups is not hereditary. the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party. admission to either branch of the party is by examination [???] taken at the age of sixteen. nor is there any [???] [???] [???] or any marked domination of one province by another. jews [???] [???] [???] south [???] of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party [???] and the [???] of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a [???] population ruled from a distant capital. oceania has no capital [???] and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows. except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak its official language [???] it is not [???] in any way. its rule rs are not held together by [???] but by [???] to a common doctrine. it is true that our society is stratified [???] and very rig idly stratified [???] on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. there is far less [???] movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the [???] age. between the two branches of the party there is a certain amount of interchange [???] but only so much as will ensu re that weaklings are [???] from the inner party and that ambitious members of the outer party are made harmless by allow ing them to rise. [???] [???] in practice [???] are not allowed to graduate into the party. the most gift ed among them [???] who might possibly become [???] of discontent [???] are simply marked down by the thought police and [???]. but this state of affairs is not necessarily perman ent [???] nor is it a matter of principle. the party is not a class in the old sense of the word. it does not aim at [???] power to its own children [???] as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the able st people at the top [???] it would be perfectly prepared to [???] an entire new generation from the ranks of the [???]. in the [???] years [???] the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to [???] opposition. the older kind of socialist [???] who had been train ed to fight against something called' class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be perman ent. he did not see that the continuity of an [???] need not be physical [???] nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary [???] have always been short lived [???] whereas adoptive [???] such as the [???] church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. the essence of [???] rule is not [???] inheritance [???] but the [???] of a certain [???] and a certain way of life [???] imposed by the dead upon the living. a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors. the party is not concerned with [???] its blood but with [???] itself. who [???] power is not important [???] provided that the [???] structure remains always the same. all the beliefs [???] habits [???] tastes [???] emotions [???] mental attitudes that characterize our time are really design ed to sustain the [???] of the party and prevent the true nature of [???] society from being perceived. physical rebellion [???] or any [???] move towards rebellion [???] is at present not possible. from the [???] nothing is to be feared. left to themselves [???] they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century [???] working [???] breeding [???] and dying [???] not only without any impulse to rebel [???] but without the power of grasp ing that the world could be other than it is. they could only become dangerous if the advance of industri al [???] made it necessary to educ ate them more highly; but [???] since military and [???] rival ry are no longer important [???] the level of popular education is actually declining. what opinions the masses hold [???] or do not hold [???] is looked on as a matter of indifference. they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. in a party member [???] on the other hand [???] not even the smallest [???] of opinion on the most un important subject can be tolerated. a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police. even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone. wherever he may be [???] asleep or awake [???] working or rest ing [???] in his bath or in bed [???] he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected. nothing that he does is indifferent. his friendships [???] his [???] [???] his behaviour towards his wife and children [???] the expression of his face when he is alone [???] the words he mutters in sleep [???] even the characteristic movements of his body [???] are all jealous ly [???]. not only any actual [???] [???] but any [???] [???] however small [???] any change of habits [???] any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symp tom of an inner struggle [???] is certain to be detected. he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. on the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. in oceania there is no law. thoughts and actions which [???] when detected [???] mean certain death are not formal ly forbidden [???] and the endless purg es [???] arrests [???] tortures [???] imprisonments [???] and [???] are not [???] as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed [???] but are merely the [???] of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future. a party member is required to have not only the right opinions [???] but the right instincts. many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stat ed [???] and could not be stat ed without laying bare the contradictions inher ent in ingsoc. if he is a person naturally orthodox( in newspeak a [???] [???] he will in all circumstances know [???] without taking thought [???] what is the true belief or the desir able emotion. but in any case an [???] mental train ing [???] undergone in childhood and group ing itself round the newspeak words crime stop [???] black white [???] and doublethink [???] makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever. a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from [???]. he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and [???] traitors [???] triumph over victories [???] and [???] before the power and wisdom of the party. the discontents produced by his bare [???] [???] life are deliberate ly turned outwards and [???] by such devices as the two minutes hate [???] and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. the first and simplest stage in the discipline [???] which can be taught even to young children [???] is called [???] in newspeak [???] crime stop. crime stop means the faculty of stopping short [???] as though by instinct [???] at the [???] of any dangerous thought. it includes the power of not grasp ing [???] [???] of fail ing to perceive [???] errors [???] of mis understanding the simplest arguments if they are [???] to ingsoc [???] and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretic al direction. crime stop [???] in short [???] means protective stupidity. but stupidity is not enough. on the contrary [???] orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over [???] own mental process es as complete as that of a [???] over his body. oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is [???] and that the party is infallible. but since in reality big brother is not [???] and the party is not infallible [???] there is need for an [???] [???] [???] [???] in the treat ment of facts. the key word here is black white. like so many newspeak words [???] this word has two mutual ly contradictory meanings. applied to an [???] [???] it means the habit of impudently claim ing that black is white [???] in contradiction of the plain facts. applied to a party member [???] it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this. but it means also the ability to believe that black is white [???] and more [???] to know that black is white [???] and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. this demands a continuous alteration of the past [???] made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest [???] and which is known in newspeak as doublethink. the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons [???] one of which is [???] and [???] so to speak [???] [???]. the [???] reason is that the party member [???] like the [???] [???] tolerates [???] conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. he must be cut off from the past [???] just as he must be cut off from foreign countries [???] because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the ave rage level of material comfort is constantly rising. but by far the more important reason for the [???] of the past is the need to safe guard the infallibility of the party. it is not merely that speeches [???] [???] [???] and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the [???] of the party were in all cases right. it is also that no change in doctrine or in political [???] can ever be admitted. for to change [???] mind [???] or even [???] policy [???] is a confession of weakness. if [???] for example [???] eurasia or eastasia [???] it may be) is the enemy today [???] then that country must always have been the enemy. and if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. thus history is continuously re written. this [???] falsification of the past [???] carried out by the ministry of truth [???] is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and [???] carried out by the ministry of love. the mut ability of the past is the central ten et of ingsoc. past events [???] it is argued [???] have no objective existence [???] but survive only in written records and in human memories. the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. and since the party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members [???] it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it. it also follows that though the past is alter able [???] it never has been altered in any [???] instance. for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment [???] then this new version is the past [???] and no different past can ever have existed. this holds good even when [???] as often happens [???] the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year. at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth [???] and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now. it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the train ing of memory. to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner. and if it is necessary to rear range [???] memories or to tamper with written records [???] then it is necessary to forget that one has done so. the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental [???]. it is learned by the majority of party members [???] and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox. in oldspeak it is called [???] quite frank ly [???]' reality control'. in newspeak it is called doublethink [???] though doublethink comprises much else as well. doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in [???] mind simultaneously [???] and accept ing both of them. the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not viola ted. the process has to be conscious [???] or it would not be carried out with sufficient [???] [???] but it also has to be unconscious [???] or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc [???] since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retain ing the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. to tell deliberate lies while [???] believ ing in them [???] to forget any fact that has become in convenient [???] and then [???] when it becomes necessary again [???] to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed [???] to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one [???] this is [???] necessary. even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. for by using the word one admits that one is [???] with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on [???] [???] with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been [???] may [???] for all we know [???] continue to be able for thousands of [???] arrest the course of history. all past [???] have fallen from power either because they [???] or because they grew soft. either they became stupid and arrog ant [???] failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances [???] and were overthrown; or they became liberal and cowardly [???] made [???] when they should have used force [???] and once again were overthrown. they fell [???] that is to say [???] either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. it is the achieve ment of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. and upon no other intellectual bas is could the dominion of the party be made perman ent. if one is to rule [???] and to continue ruling [???] one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. for the secret of [???] is to comb ine a belief in [???] own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes. it need hardly be said that the subtle st [???] of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. in our society [???] those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. in general [???] the greater the understanding [???] the greater the delusion; the more intelligent [???] the less sane. one clear illustration of this is the fact that war [???] increases in [???] as one rises in the social scale. those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly ration al are the subject peoples of the disputed territories. to these people the war is simply a continuous cal amity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tid al wave. which side is win ning is a matter of complete indifference to them. they are aware that a change of over lordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones. the slightly more favoured workers whom we call'the proles' are only [???] conscious of the war. when it is necessary they can be prod ded into frenzies of fear and hatred [???] but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. it is in the ranks of the party [???] and above all of the inner party [???] that the true war [???] is found. [???] is believed in most firm ly by those who know it to be impossible. this peculiar [???] of [???] with ignorance [???] [???] with [???] one of the chief distinguish ing marks of oceanic society. the official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them. thus [???] the party [???] and [???] every principle for which the socialist movement original ly stood [???] and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism. it [???] a contempt for the working class [???] for [???] past [???] and it dress es its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason. it systematically [???] the [???] of the family [???] and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. even the names of the four ministries by which we are govern ed exhib it a sort of impudence in their deliberate rever sal of the facts. the ministry of peace concerns itself with war [???] the ministry of truth with lies [???] the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation. these contradictions are not accident al [???] nor do they res ult from ordinary [???]; they are deliberate exercises in doublethink. for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retain ed [???]. in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. if human equality is to be for ever [???] the high [???] as we have called them [???] are to keep their places [???] the prevail ing mental condition must be control led [???]. but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignor ed. it is; why should human equality be averted? supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described [???] what is the motive for this huge [???] accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time? here we reach the central secret. as we have seen. the [???] of the party [???] and above all of the inner party [???] depends upon doublethink but deeper than this lies the original motive [???] the [???] instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink [???] the thought police [???] continuous war fare [???] and all the other necessary [???] into existence afterwards. this motive really [???]. winston became aware of silence [???] as one becomes aware of a new sound. it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past. she was lying on her side [???] naked from the waist upwards [???] with her cheek pillow ed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. her breast rose and fell slowly and regular ly. [???]' no answer.' julia [???] are you awake?' no answer. she was asleep. he shut the book [???] put it carefully on the floor [???] lay down [???] and pulled the coverlet over both of them. he had still [???] he reflected [???] not learned the ultimate secret. he understood how; he did not understand why. chapter i [???] like chapter iii [???] had not actually told him anything that he did not know [???] it had merely [???] the knowledge that he possessed already. but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad. being in a minority [???] even a minority of one [???] did not make you mad. there was truth and there was unt ruth [???] and if you cl ung to the truth even against the whole world [???] you were not mad. a yellow beam from the sinking sun [???] in through the window and fell across the pillow. he shut his eyes. the sun on his face and the [???] smooth body touching his own gave him a strong [???] sleepy [???] confident feeling. he was safe [???] everything was all right. he fell asleep murmur ing [???] is not [???]' with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom. [???]* when he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time [???] but a glance at the [???] clock told him that it was only [???]. he lay dozing for a while; then the usual [???] singing struck up from the yard below:' it was only an [???] fancy [???] it passed like an [???] dye [???] but a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred they' ave stolen my'eart [???]' the drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity. you still heard it all over the place. it had outlived the hate song. julia woke at the sound [???] stretch ed herself [???] [???] and got out of bed. [???] [???]' she said. [???] make some more coffee. damn! the [???] gone out and the [???] cold.' she picked the sto ve up and shook it. [???] no oil in it.''we can get some from old charrington [???] i expect.''the funny thing is i made sure it was full. [???] going to put my clothes [???]' she added.' it seems to have got [???]' winston also got up and dressed himself. the [???] voice sang on:' they sye that time [???] all things [???] they sye you can always forget; but the smiles an' the tears [???] the years they twist my [???] yet!' as he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window. the sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. the flag stones were wet as though they had just been washed [???] and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too [???] so fresh and pale was the blue between the [???]. [???] the woman march ed to and fro [???] corking and [???] herself [???] singing and falling silent [???] and pegging out more [???] [???] and more and yet more. he wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grand children. julia had come across to his side; together they gazed down with a sort of [???] at the [???] figure below. as he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude [???] her thick arms reach ing up for the line [???] her powerful [???] [???] [???] [???] it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful. it had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty [???] blown up to monstrous [???] by child bearing [???] then hardened [???] roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an [???] turnip [???] could be beautiful. but it was so [???] and after all [???] he thought [???] why not? the solid [???] [???] body [???] like a block of [???] [???] and the rasping red skin [???] bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the [???] to the rose. why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower? [???] [???]' he murmured. [???] a met re across the hips [???] [???]' said julia.' that is her style of [???]' said winston. he held [???] supple waist easily [???] by his arm. from the hip to the knee her fl ank was against his. out of their bodies no child would ever come. that was the one thing they could never do. only by word of mouth [???] from mind to mind [???] could they pass on the secret. the woman down there had no mind [???] she had only strong arms [???] a warm heart [???] and a fertile belly. he wondered how many children she had given birth to. it might easily be fifteen. she had had her momentary flower ing [???] a year [???] perhaps [???] of [???] beauty and then she had suddenly [???] like a [???] fruit and grown hard and red and coarse [???] and then her life had been [???] [???] [???] [???] dar ning [???] cooking [???] sweep ing [???] polishing [???] mend ing [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] first for children [???] then for grand children [???] over thirty un broken years. at the end of it she was still singing. the mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale [???] cloud less sky [???] stretch ing away behind the [???] into interminable distance. it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody [???] in eurasia or eastasia as well as here. and the people under the sky were also very much the [???] [???] all over the world [???] hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this [???] people ignorant of one [???] existence [???] held apart by walls of hatred and lies [???] and yet almost exactly the [???] who had never learned to think but who were stor ing up in their hearts and bellies and [???] the power that would one day overturn the world. if there was hope [???] it lay in the proles! without having read to the end of the book [???] he knew that that must be [???] final message. the future belong ed to the proles. and could he be sure that when their time came the world they [???] would not be just as ali en to him [???] winston smith [???] as the world of the party? yes [???] because at the least it would be a world of sanity. where there is equality there can be sanity. sooner or later it would happen [???] strength would change into consciousness. the proles were immortal [???] you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. in the end their awakening would come. and until that happened [???] though it might be a thousand years [???] they would stay alive against all the odds [???] like birds [???] passing on from body to body the [???] which the party did not share and could not kill.' do you [???]' he said [???]'the thrush that sang to us [???] that first day [???] at the edge of the wood?''he [???] singing to [???]' said julia.'he was singing to please himself. not even that. he was just singing.' the birds sang [???] the proles sang. the party did not sing. all round the world [???] in london and new york [???] in africa and [???] [???] and in the mysterious [???] forbidden lands beyond the frontiers [???] in the streets of paris and berlin [???] in the villages of the endless russian plain [???] in the [???] of china and [???] stood the same solid [???] figure [???] made monstrous by work and child bearing [???] toil ing from birth to death and still singing. out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come. you were the dead [???] theirs was the future. but you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body [???] and passed on the secret doctrine that two pl us two make four.'we are the [???]' he said.'we are the [???]' echo ed julia dutifully.' you are the [???]' said an iron voice behind them. they spr ang apart. [???] entrails seemed to have turned into ice. he could see the white all round the irises of [???] eyes. her face had turned a milky yellow. the smear of rou ge that was still on each cheek bone stood out sharp ly [???] almost as though [???] with the skin beneath.' you are the [???]' repeated the iron voice.' it was behind the [???]' breathed julia.' it was behind the [???]' said the voice.' remain exactly where you are. make no movement until you are ordered.' it was starting [???] it was starting at last! they could do nothing except stand gazing into one [???] eyes. to run for life [???] to get out of the house before it was too [???] such thought occurred to them. [???] to disobey the iron voice from the wall. there was a sn ap as though a catch had been turned back [???] and a crash of breaking glass. the picture had fallen to the floor uncover ing the telescreen behind it.'now they can see [???]' said julia.'now we can see [???]' said the voice.'stand out in the middle of the room. stand back to back. clasp your hands behind your heads. do not touch one another.' they were not touching [???] but it seemed to him that he could feel [???] body shaking. or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. he could just stop his teeth from chattering [???] but his knees were beyond his control. there was a sound of tramp ling boots below [???] inside the house and outside. the yard seemed to be full of men. something was being dragged across the stones. the [???] singing had stopped abrupt ly. there was a long [???] rolling cl ang [???] as though the wash tub had been flung across the yard [???] and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.'the house is [???]' said winston.'the house is [???]' said the voice. he heard julia sn ap her teeth together.'i suppose we may as well say [???]' she said.' you may as well say [???]' said the voice. and then another quite different voice [???] a thin [???] [???] voice which winston had the impression of having heard before [???] struck in;'and by the way [???] while we are on the subject [???] [???] comes a candle to light you to bed [???] here comes a chopper to chop off your [???]' something cra shed on to the bed behind [???] back. the head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. someone was climb ing through the window. there was a [???] of boots up the stairs. the room was full of solid men in black uniforms [???] with [???] boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands. winston was not trembling any longer. even his eyes he barely moved. one thing alone mattered; to keep still [???] to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! a man with a smooth [???] j owl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his trunche on [???] between thumb and forefinger. winston met his eyes. the feeling of nakedness [???] with [???] hands behind [???] head and [???] face and body all exposed [???] was almost [???]. the man [???] the tip of a white tongue [???] licked the place where his lips should have been [???] and then passed on. there was another crash. someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smash ed it to pieces on the [???]. the fragment of cor al [???] a tiny [???] of pink like a sugar rose bud from a cake [???] rolled across the mat. how small [???] thought winston [???] how small it always was! there was a gasp and a thump behind him [???] and he received a violent kick on the ank le which nearly flung him off his balance. one of the men had smash ed his fist into [???] sol ar [???] [???] doub ling her up like a pocket ruler. she was [???] about on the floor [???] fighting for breath. winston dared not turn his head even by a [???] [???] but sometimes her liv id [???] gasping face came within the angle of his vision. even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body [???] the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urg ent than the struggle to get back her breath. he knew what it was like; the terrible [???] [???] pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet [???] because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders [???] and carried her out of the room like a sack. winston had a glimpse of her face [???] upside down [???] yellow and contorted [???] with the eyes shut [???] and still with a smear of rou ge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her. he stood dead still. no one had hit him yet. thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally [???] began to fl it through his mind. he wondered whether they had got mr charrington. he wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard. he noticed that he bad ly wanted to urinate [???] and felt a faint surprise [???] because he had done so only two or three hours ago. he noticed that the clock on the [???] said nine [???] meaning [???]. but the light seemed too strong. would not the light be fa ding at [???] hours on an august evening? he wondered whether after all he and julia had mistaken the [???] slept the clock round and thought it was [???] when really it was nought [???] on the following morning. but he did not pursue the thought further. it was not interest ing. there was another [???] lighter step in the passage. mr charrington came into the room. the demean our of the [???] men suddenly became more subdued. something had also changed in mr [???] appearance. his eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.' pick up those [???]' he said sharp ly. a man stoop ed to obey. the cockney accent had disappeared; winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jack et [???] but his hair [???] which had been almost white [???] had turned black. also he was not wearing his spectacles. he gave winston a single sharp glance [???] as though verifying his identity [???] and then paid no more attention to him. he was still [???] [???] but he was not the same person any longer. his body had straightened [???] and seemed to have grown bigger. his face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation. the black eyebrows were less bushy [???] the wrinkles were gone [???] the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed short er. it was the ale rt [???] cold face of a man of about [???]. it occurred to winston that for the first time in his life he was looking [???] with knowledge [???] at a member of the thought police. part three chapter 1 he did not know where he was. presumably he was in the ministry of love [???] but there was no way of making certain. he was in a [???] window less cell with walls of glittering white [???]. concealed lamps flood ed it with cold light [???] and there was a low [???] steady hum ming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. a bench [???] or shelf [???] just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall [???] broken only by the door and [???] at the end opposite the door [???] a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. there were four telescreens [???] one in each wall. there was a dull ach ing in his belly. it had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. but he was also hungry [???] with a gnaw ing [???] unwholesome kind of hunger. it might be [???] hours since he had eaten [???] it might be [???]. he still did not know [???] probably never would know [???] whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. since he was arrested he had not been fed. he sat as still as he could on the narrow bench [???] with his hands crossed on his knee. he had already learned to sit still. if you made unexpected movements they yell ed at you from the telescreen. but the craving for food was growing upon him. what he long ed for above all was a piece of bread. he had an idea that there were a few [???] in the pocket of his overalls. it was even [???] thought this because from time to time something seemed to tick le his [???] there might be a size able bit of crust there. in the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket. [???]' yell ed a voice from the telescreen. [???] smith w.! hands out of pockets in the [???]' he sat still again [???] his hands crossed on his knee. before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary [???] used by the patrols. he did not know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to [???] the time. it was a noisy [???] [???] place. they had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in [???] but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. the majority of them were common criminals [???] but there were a few political prisoners among them. he had sat silent against the wall [???] [???] by dirty bodies [???] too [???] by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his [???] [???] but still noticing the astonish ing difference in demean our between the party prisoners and the others. the party prisoners were always silent and terrified [???] but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody. they yell ed insults at the guards [???] fought back fierce ly when their belongings were impounded [???] wrote obscene words on the floor [???] ate [???] food which they produced from mysterious [???] in their clothes [???] and even shout ed down the telescreen when it tried to restore order. on the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards [???] called them by nick names [???] and tried to [???] cigarettes through the spy hole in the door. the guards [???] too [???] treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance [???] even when they had to handle them rough ly. there was much talk about the [???] camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent. it was' all right' in the camps [???] he gather ed [???] so long as you had good cont acts and knew the ropes. there was bribery [???] [???] [???] and [???] of every kind [???] there was [???] and [???] [???] there was even [???] [???] distilled from [???]. the positions of trust were given only to the common criminals [???] especially the [???] and the murderers [???] who formed a sort of [???]. all the dirty jobs were done by the politicals. there was a constant [???] of prisoners of every description: [???] [???] thieves [???] band its [???] [???] [???] drunks [???] [???]. some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to comb ine to sup press them. an enormous wreck of a woman [???] aged about sixty [???] with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles [???] was carried in [???] kick ing and shouting [???] by four guards [???] who had hold of her one at each corner. they wrench ed off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them [???] and dumped her down across [???] lap [???] almost breaking his [???]. the woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of [???]- bastards!' then [???] noticing that she was sitting on something une ven [???] she slid off [???] knees on to the bench.' beg pardon [???] [???]' she said.'i [???]'a sat on you [???] only the [???] put me there. they dono' ow to treat a lady [???] do they?' she paused [???] pat ted her breast [???] and belched. [???]' she said [???]'i [???] me self [???] quite.' she leant forward and [???] copiously on the floor. [???] [???]' she said [???] leaning back with closed eyes.' never keep it down [???] th ass what i say. get it up while [???] fresh on your stomach [???] like.' she revived [???] turned to have another look at winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. she put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her [???] breathing beer and vomit into his face. [???] your name [???] [???]' she said. [???]' said winston. [???]' said the woman. [???] funny. my [???] smith too. [???]' she added [???] [???]'i might be your mother!' she might [???] thought winston [???] be his mother. she was about the right age and [???] [???] and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a [???] camp. no one else had spoken to him. to a surpris ing extent the ordinary criminals ignor ed the party prisoners.'the [???]' they called them [???] with a sort of un interested contempt. the party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody [???] and above all of speaking to one another. only once [???] when two party members [???] both women [???] were pressed close together on the bench [???] he overheard amid the din of voices a few [???] words; and in particular a reference to something called'room [???] [???] which he did not understand. it might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. the dull pain in his belly never went away [???] but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse [???] and his thoughts [???] or contracted accordingly. when it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself [???] and of his desire for food. when it grew better [???] panic took hold of him. there were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart [???] and his breath stopped. he felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and [???] boots on his sh ins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor [???] screaming for mercy through broken teeth. he hardly thought of julia. he could not fix his mind on her. he loved her and would not betray her; but that was only a fact [???] known as he knew the rules of [???]. he felt no love for her [???] and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her. he thought often er of [???] [???] with a [???] hope. [???] might know that he had been arrested. the brotherhood [???] he had said [???] never tried to save its members. but there was the razor blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. there would be perhaps five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. the blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness [???] and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. everything came back to his sick body [???] which shr ank trembling from the smallest pain. he was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance. it was more natural to exist from moment to moment [???] accept ing another ten minutes' life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it. sometimes he tried to calcul ate the number of [???] bricks in the walls of the cell. it should have been easy [???] but he always lost count at some point or another. more often he wondered where he was [???] and what time of day it was. at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside [???] and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. in this place [???] he knew instinctively [???] the lights would never be turned out. it was the place with no darkness: he saw now why [???] had seemed to recognize the allusion. in the ministry of love there were no windows. his cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might be ten floors below ground [???] or thirty above it. he moved himself mental ly from place to place [???] and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground. there was a sound of marching boots outside. the steel door opened with a cl ang. a young officer [???] a trim [???] figure who seemed to glit ter all over with poli shed leather [???] and whose pale [???] [???] face was like a wax mask [???] stepped smart ly through the door way. he motion ed to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. the poet ampleforth shambled into the cell. the door clanged shut again. ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side [???] as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of [???] and then began to wander up and down the cell. he had not yet noticed [???] presence. his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a met re above the level of [???] head. he was shoe less; large [???] dirty toes were stick ing out of the holes in his socks. he was also several days away from a sha ve. a [???] beard covered his face to the cheek bones [???] giving him an air of ruffianism that went odd ly with his large weak frame and nervous movements. winston rou sed himself a little from his [???]. he must speak to ampleforth [???] and risk the yell from the telescreen. it was even conceivable that ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade. [???]' he said. there was no yell from the telescreen. ampleforth paused [???] mild ly startled. his eyes [???] themselves slowly on winston.'ah [???] smith!' he said.' you too!'' what are you in for?''to tell you the [???]' he sat down [???] on the bench opposite winston.' there is only one offence [???] is there not?' he said.'and have you committed it?' [???] i have.' he put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment [???] as though trying to remember something.' these things [???]' he began vaguely.'i have been able to recall one [???] possible instance. it was an in discretion [???] undoubted ly. we were producing a [???] edition of the [???] of [???]. i allowed the word [???] [???] to remain at the end of a line. i could not help it!' he added almost indignantly [???] raising his face to look at winston.' it was impossible to change the line. the rhyme was [???]. do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to [???] [???] in the entire language? for days i had rack ed my brains. there was no other rhyme.' the expression on his face changed. the annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. a sort of intellectual warmth [???] the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact [???] shone through the dirt and [???] hair.' has it ever occurred to [???]' he said [???]' that the whole history of english poet ry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacks rhymes?' no [???] that particular thought had never occurred to winston. nor [???] in the circumstances [???] did it strike him as very important or interest ing.' do you know what time of day it is?' he said. ampleforth looked startled again.'i had hardly thought about it. they arrested [???] could be two days [???] three.' his eyes flitted round the walls [???] as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.' there is no difference between night and day in this place. i do not see how one can calcul ate the time.' they talked [???] for some minutes [???] then [???] without apparent reason [???] a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. winston sat quietly [???] his hands crossed. ampleforth [???] too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench [???] [???] from side to side [???] clasping his lank hands first round one knee [???] then round the other. the telescreen bark ed at him to keep still. time passed. twenty minutes [???] an [???] was difficult to judge. once more there was a sound of boots outside. [???] entrails contracted. soon [???] very soon [???] perhaps in five minutes [???] perhaps now [???] the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come. the door opened. the [???] young officer stepped into the cell. with a brief movement of the hand he [???] ampleforth.'room [???]' he said. ampleforth march ed [???] out between the guards [???] his face vaguely [???] [???] but [???]. what seemed like a long time passed. the pain in [???] belly had revived. his mind sagged round and round on the same trick [???] like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. he had only six thoughts. the pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; [???]; julia; the razor blade. there was another spasm in his entrails [???] the heavy boots were approach ing. as the door opened [???] the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. parsons walked into the cell. he was wearing [???] shorts and a [???]. this time winston was startled into [???].' you here!' he said. parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise [???] but only misery. he began walking jerkily up and down [???] evidently unable to keep still. each time he straightened his pud gy knees it was apparent that they were trembling. his eyes had a [???] [???] staring look [???] as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance.' what are you in for?' said winston. [???]' said parsons [???] almost [???]. the tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of [???] horror that such a word could be applied to himself. he paused opposite winston and began eager ly appeal ing to him:' you [???] think [???] shoot me [???] do you [???] old chap? they [???] shoot you if you [???] actually done [???] thoughts [???] which you [???] help? i know they give you a fair hearing. oh [???] i trust them for that! [???] know my record [???] [???] they? you know what kind of chap i was. not a bad chap in my way. not brainy [???] of course [???] but keen. i tried to do my best for the party [???] [???] i? [???] get off with five years [???] [???] you think? or even ten years? a chap like me could make himself pretty use ful in a [???]. they [???] shoot me for going off the rails just once?''are you guilty?' said winston.'of course [???] guilty!' cried parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen.' you [???] think the party would arrest an innocent man [???] do you?' his [???] face grew calm er [???] and even took on a slightly [???] expression. [???] is a dreadful thing [???] old [???]' he said [???]. [???] [???]. it can get hold of you without your even knowing it. do you know how it got hold of me? in my sleep! yes [???] [???] a fact. there i was [???] working away [???] trying to do my [???] knew i had any bad stuff in my mind at all. and then i started talking in my sleep. do you know what they heard me saying?' he sank his voice [???] like someone who is obliged for medic al reasons to utter an [???]. [???] with big brother! [???] yes [???] i said that! said it over and over again [???] it seems. between you and me [???] old man [???] [???] glad they got me before it went any further. do you know what [???] going to say to them when i go up before the [???]? [???] [???] [???] [???] going to say [???] [???] you for saving me before it was too [???]'' who denounced you?' said winston.' it was my little [???]' said parsons with a sort of dole ful pride.' she listen ed at the key hole. heard what i was saying [???] and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. pretty smart for a [???] of seven [???] eh? i [???] bear her any grudge for it. in fact [???] proud of her. it shows i brought her up in the right spirit [???] [???]' he made a few more jerky movements up and down [???] several times [???] casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan. then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.' excuse me [???] old [???]' he said.'i [???] help it. [???] the waiting.' he [???] his large posterior into the lavatory pan. winston covered his face with his hands. [???]' yell ed the voice from the telescreen. [???] smith w.! uncover your face. no faces covered in the [???]' winston uncover ed his face. parsons used the lavatory [???] loud ly and abundantly. it then turned out that the pl ug was defective and the cell stank [???] for hours afterwards. parsons was removed. more prisoners came and went [???] mysterious ly. one [???] a woman [???] was [???] to'room 101' [???] and [???] winston noticed [???] seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard the words. a time came when [???] if it had been morning when he was brought here [???] it would be afternoon; or if it had been afternoon [???] then it would be midnight. there were six prisoners in the cell [???] men and women. all sat very still. opposite winston there sat a man with a chin less [???] toothy face exactly like that of some large [???] harmless rod ent. his fat [???] mottled cheeks were so [???] at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stor es of food tuck ed away there. his [???] eyes flitted [???] from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught [???] eye. the door opened [???] and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary ch ill through winston. he was a common place [???] [???] man who might have been an engine er or [???] of some kind. but what was startling was the [???] of his face. it was like a skull. because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked [???] large [???] and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous [???] [???] hatred of somebody or something. the man sat down on the bench at a little distance from winston. winston did not look at him again [???] but the torment ed [???] [???] face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes. suddenly he realized what was the matter. the man was dying of starvation. the same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell. there was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. the eyes of the chin less man kept flitting towards the [???] man [???] then turning guiltily away [???] then being dragged back by an [???] attraction. presently he began to fidget on his seat. at last he stood up [???] [???] [???] across the cell [???] dug down into the pocket of his overalls [???] and [???] with an [???] air [???] held out a grimy piece of bread to the [???] man. there was a furious [???] deafening roar from the telescreen. the chin less man jump ed in his tracks. the [???] man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back [???] as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift. [???]' roar ed the voice. [???] [???] j.! let fall that piece of bread!' the chin less man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.' remain standing where you [???]' said the voice.'face the door. make no movement.' the chin less man obey ed. his large [???] cheeks were [???] [???]. the door clanged open. as the young officer entered and stepped aside [???] there [???] from behind him a short [???] guard with enormous arms and shoulders. he took his stand opposite the chin less man [???] and then [???] at a signal from the officer [???] let free a fright ful blow [???] with all the weight of his body behind it [???] full in the chin less [???] mouth. the force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. his body was flung across the cell and fetch ed up against the base of the lavatory seat. for a moment he lay as though [???] [???] with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose. a very faint [???] or squeaking [???] which seemed unconscious [???] came out of him. then he rolled over and raised himself un steadily on hands and knees. amid a stream of blood and [???] [???] the two hal ves of a den tal plate fell out of his mouth. the prisoners sat very still [???] their hands crossed on their knees. the chin less man climb ed back into his place. down one side of his face the flesh was darkening. his mouth had [???] into a shapeless [???] mass with a black hole in the middle of it. from time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls. his grey eyes still flitted from face to face [???] more guiltily than ever [???] as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his [???]. the door opened. with a small gesture the officer [???] the [???] man.'room [???]' he said. there was a gasp and a [???] at [???] side. the man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor [???] with his hand clasped together.' comrade! officer!' he cried.' you [???] have to take me to that place! [???] i told you everything already? what else is it you want to know? [???] nothing i [???] confess [???] nothing! just tell me what it is and [???] confess straight off. write it down and [???] sign [???]! not room 101!''room [???]' said the officer. the [???] face [???] already very pale [???] turned a colour winston would not have believed possible. it was definite ly [???] [???] [???] a shade of green.' do anything to me!' he yell ed.

[???] the one you ought to be taking [???] not me!' he shout ed.' you [???] hear what he was saying after they ba shed his face. give me a chance and [???] tell you every word of it. [???] the one [???] against the party [???] not me.' the guards stepped forward. the [???] voice rose to a shriek.' you [???] hear him!' he repeated.' something went wrong with the telescreen. [???] the one you want. take him [???] not me!' the two [???] guards had stoop ed to take him by the arms. but just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and [???] one of the iron legs that support ed the bench. he had set up a word less howling [???] like an anim al. the guards took hold of him to wrench him loose [???] but he cl ung on with astonish ing strength. for perhaps twenty seconds they were [???] at him. the prisoners sat quiet [???] their hands crossed on their knees [???] looking straight in front of them. the howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. then there was a different kind of cry. a kick from a [???] boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands. they dragged him to his feet.'room [???]' said the officer. the man was led out [???] walking un steadily [???] with head sun ken [???] nurs ing his crush ed hand [???] all the fight had gone out of him. a long time passed. if it had been midnight when the [???] man was taken away [???] it was morning: if morning [???] it was afternoon. winston was alone [???] and had been alone for hours. the pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about [???] unre proved by the telescreen. the piece of bread still lay where the chin less man had dropped it. at the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it [???] but presently hunger gave way to thirst. his mouth was sticky and [???]. the hum ming sound and the [???] white light induced a sort of faintness [???] an empty feeling inside his head. he would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bear able [???] and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too [???] to make sure of staying on his feet. whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned. sometimes with a fa ding hope he thought of [???] and the razor blade. it was think able that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food [???] if he were ever fed. more dim ly he thought of julia. somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. she might be screaming with pain at this moment. he thought:'if i could save julia by doub ling my own pain [???] would i do it? yes [???] i would.' but that was merely an intellectual decision [???] taken because he knew that he ought to take it. he did not feel it. in this place you could not feel anything [???] except pain and fore knowledge of pain. besides [???] was it possible [???] when you were actually suffering it [???] to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase? but that question was not answer able yet. the boots were approach ing again. the door opened. [???] came in. winston started to his feet. the shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. for the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen. [???] got you too!' he cried.' they got me a long time [???]' said [???] with a mild [???] almost [???] irony. he stepped aside. from behind him there [???] a [???] guard with a long black trunche on in his hand.' you know this [???] [???]' said [???]. [???] deceive yourself. you did know [???] have always known it.' yes [???] he saw now [???] he had always known it. but there was no time to think of that. all he had eyes for was the trunche on in the [???] hand. it might fall anywhere; on the crown [???] on the tip of the ear [???] on the upper arm [???] on the [???]- the elbow! he had [???] to his knees [???] almost [???] [???] clasping the [???] elbow with his other hand. everything had explo ded into yellow light. [???] [???] [???] that one blow could cause such pain! the light clear ed and he could see the other two looking down at him. the guard was laughing at his [???]. one question at any rate was answered. never [???] for any reason on earth [???] could you wish for an increase of pain. of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. in the face of pain there are no hero es [???] no hero es [???] he thought over and over as he [???] on the floor [???] clutch ing useless ly at his [???] left arm. chapter 2 he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed [???] except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move. light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. [???] was standing at his side [???] looking down at him intent ly. at the other side of him stood a man in a white coat [???] holding a [???] [???]. even after his eyes were open he took in his [???] only gradually. he had the impression of swim ming up into this room from some quite different world [???] a sort of underwater world far beneath it. how long he had been down there he did not know. since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight. besides [???] his memories were not continuous. there had been times when consciousness [???] even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep [???] had stopped dead and started again after a blank interv al. but whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds [???] there was no way of knowing. with that first blow on the elbow the night mare had started. later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a [???] [???] a rout ine [???] to which nearly all prisoners were subject ed. there was a long range of [???] [???] [???] [???] and the [???] which everyone had to confess as a matter of course. the confession was a formality [???] though the torture was real. how many times he had been beaten [???] how long the beatings had continued [???] he could not remember. always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. sometimes it was fists [???] sometimes it was truncheons [???] sometimes it was steel rods [???] sometimes it was boots. there were times when he rolled about the floor [???] as shameless as an anim al [???] [???] his body this way and that in an endless [???] hopeless effort to [???] the kicks [???] and simply inviting more and yet more kicks [???] in his ribs [???] in his belly [???] on his elbows [???] on his sh ins [???] in his gro in [???] in his testicles [???] on the bone at the base of his spine. there were times when it went on and on until the cruel [???] wicked [???] [???] thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness. there were times when his ner ve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began [???] when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. there were other times when he started out with the resolve of confess ing nothing [???] when every word had to be forced out of him between [???] of pain [???] and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise [???] when he said to himself:'i will confess [???] but not yet. i must hold out till the pain becomes [???]. three more kicks [???] two more kicks [???] and then i will tell them what they want.' sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand [???] then flung like a sack of [???] on to the stone floor of a cell [???] left to [???] for a few hours [???] and then taken out and beaten again. there were also longer periods of recovery. he remembered them dim ly [???] because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stup or. he remembered a cell with a plank bed [???] a sort of shelf stick ing out from the wall [???] and a tin [???] [???] and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. he remembered a sur ly barb er arriv ing to scra pe his chin and crop his hair [???] and businesslike [???] [???] men in white coats feeling his pul se [???] tapping his [???] [???] turning up his eyelids [???] running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones [???] and shoot ing needles into his arm to make him sleep. the beatings grew less frequent [???] and became main ly a threat [???] a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were [???]. his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals [???] little rot und men with quick movements and flash ing spectacles [???] who worked on him in relays over periods which [???] thought [???] he could not be [???] or twelve hours at a stretch. these other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain [???] but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. they slapped his face [???] wr ung his ears [???] pulled his hair [???] made him stand on one leg [???] refused him leave to urinate [???] shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to [???] him and destroy his power of [???] and reason ing. their real weapon was the merciless question ing that went on and on [???] hour after hour [???] tripping him up [???] laying traps for him [???] twisting everything that he said [???] convict ing him at every step of lies and [???] until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous [???]. sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session. most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threaten ed at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune [???] call him comrade [???] appeal to him in the name of ingsoc and big brother [???] and ask him sorrow fully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done. when his ner ves were in rags after hours of question ing [???] even this appeal could reduce him to [???] tears. in the end the [???] voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. he became simply a mouth that uttered [???] a hand that sign ed [???] whatever was demanded of him. his sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess [???] and then confess it quickly [???] before the bully ing started an ew. he confessed to the [???] of eminent party members [???] the distribution of seditious [???] [???] [???] of public funds [???] sale of military secrets [???] [???] of every kind. he confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as [???]. he confessed that he was a religious believ er [???] an admirer of capitalism [???] and a sexual per vert. he confessed that he had murdered his wife [???] although he knew [???] and his questioners must have known [???] that his wife was still alive. he confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known. it was easier to confess everything and [???] everybody. besides [???] in a sense it was all true. it was true that he had been the enemy of the party [???] and in the eyes of the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed. there were also memories of another kind. they stood out in his mind [???] [???] like pictures with blackness all round them. he was in a cell which might have been either dark or light [???] because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. near at hand some kind of instrument was tick ing slowly and regular ly. the eyes grew larger and more [???]. suddenly he floated out of his seat [???] div ed into the eyes [???] and was swallowed up. he was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials [???] under [???] lights. a man in a white coat was reading the dials. there was a tramp of heavy boots outside. the door clanged open. the [???] officer march ed in [???] followed by two guards.'room [???]' said the officer. the man in the white coat did not turn round. he did not look at winston either; he was looking only at the dials. he was rolling down a mighty corrid or [???] a [???] wide [???] full of glorious [???] golden light [???] roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. he was confess ing everything [???] even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. he was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already. with him were the guards [???] the other questioners [???] the men in white coats [???] [???] [???] julia [???] mr charrington [???] all rolling down the corrid or together and shouting with laughter. some dreadful thing which had la in [???] in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened. everything was all right [???] there was no more pain [???] the last detail of his life was laid bare [???] understood [???] forgiven. he was starting up from the plank bed in the [???] that he had heard [???] voice. all through his [???] [???] although he had never seen him [???] he had had the feeling that [???] was at his elbow [???] just out of sight. it was [???] who was direct ing everything. it was he who set the guards on to winston and who prevented them from killing him. it was he who decided when winston should scre am with pain [???] when he should have a respite [???] when he should be fed [???] when he should sleep [???] when the drugs should be [???] into his arm. it was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. he was the torment or [???] he was the protector [???] he was the [???] [???] he was the friend. and [???] could not remember whether it was in [???] sleep [???] or in normal sleep [???] or even in a moment of [???] voice murmured in his ear: [???] wor ry [???] winston; you are in my keeping. for seven years i have watched over you. now the [???] has come. i shall save you [???] i shall make you perfect.' he was not sure whether it was [???] voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him [???]'we shall meet in the place where there is no [???]' in that other dream [???] seven years ago. he did not remember any ending to his [???]. there was a period of blackness and then the cell [???] or room [???] in which he now was had gradually materialized round him. he was almost flat on his back [???] and unable to move. his body was held down at every essential point. even the back of his head was gripped in some manner. [???] was looking down at him grave ly and rather sadly. his face [???] seen from below [???] looked coarse and worn [???] with [???] under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. he was older than winston had thought him; he was perhaps [???] or fifty. under his hand there was a dial with a le ver on top and figures running round the face.'i told [???]' said [???] [???]' that if we met again it would be here.' [???]' said winston. without any warning except a slight movement of [???] hand [???] a wave of pain flood ed his body. it was a frightening pain [???] because he could not see what was happening [???] and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him. he did not know whether the thing was really happening [???] or whether the effect was [???] produced; but his body was being wrench ed out of shape [???] the joints were being slowly torn apart. although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead [???] the worst of all was the fear that his back bone was about to sn ap. he set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose [???] trying to keep silent as long as possible.' you are [???]' said [???] [???] watching his face [???]' that in another moment something is going to break. your especi al fear is that it will be your back bone. you have a vivid mental picture of the [???] snapping apart and the spin al [???] dripping out of them. that is what you are thinking [???] is it not [???] winston?' winston did not answer. [???] drew back the le ver on the dial. the wave of pain rece ded almost as quickly as it had come.' that was [???]' said [???].' you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred. will you please remember [???] throughout our conversation [???] that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree i choose? if you tell me any lies [???] or attempt to [???] in any way [???] or even fall below your usual level of intelligence [???] you will cry out with pain [???] instantly. do you understand that?' [???]' said winston. [???] manner became less severe. he re settled his spectacles thought fully [???] and took a pace or two up and down. when he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. he had the air of a doctor [???] a teacher [???] even a priest [???] anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.'i am taking trouble with you [???] [???]' he said [???]' because you are worth trouble. you know perfectly well what is the matter with you. you have known it for years [???] though you have fought against the knowledge. you are mental ly deranged. you suffer from a defective memory. you are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened. fortunate ly it is cur able. you have never cu red yourself of it [???] because you did not choose to. there was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make. even now [???] i am well aware [???] you are [???] to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue. now we will take an example. at this moment [???] which power is oceania at war with?'' when i was arrested [???] oceania was at war with eastasia.''with eastasia. good. and oceania has always been at war with eastasia [???] has it not?' winston drew in his breath. he opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak. he could not take his eyes away from the dial.'the truth [???] please [???] winston. your truth. tell me what you think you remember.''i remember that until only a week before i was arrested [???] we were not at war with eastasia at all. we were in alliance with them. the war was against eurasia. that had lasted for four years. before [???]' [???] stopped him with a movement of the hand.' another [???]' he said.'some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed. you believed that three men [???] three [???] party members named jones [???] aaronson [???] and [???] who were executed for treachery and [???] after making the fullest possible [???] not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. you believed that you had seen [???] [???] evidence prov ing that their confessions were false. there was a certain photograph about which you had a [???]. you believed that you had actually held it in your hands. it was a photograph something like this.' an oblong slip of newspap er had appeared between [???] fingers. for perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of [???] vision. it was a photograph [???] and there was no question of its identity. it was the photograph. it was another copy of the photograph of jones [???] aaronson [???] and [???] at the party function in new york [???] which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and prompt ly destroyed. for only an instant it was before his eyes [???] then it was out of sight again. but he had seen it [???] [???] he had seen it! he made a desperate [???] [???] effort to wrench the top half of his body free. it was impossible to move so much as a [???] in any direction. for the moment he had even forgotten the dial. all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again [???] or at least to see it.' it exists!' he cried. [???]' said [???]. he stepped across the room. there was a memory hole in the opposite wall. [???] lifted the grat ing. unseen [???] the frail slip of paper was whir ling away on the current of warm air; it was vanish ing in a flash of flame. [???] turned away from the wall. [???]' he said.' not even [???] ashes. dust. it does not exist. it never existed.'' but it did exist! it does exist! it exists in memory. i remember it. you remember it.''i do not remember [???]' said [???]. [???] heart sank. that was doublethink. he had a feeling of deadly helplessness. if he could have been certain that [???] was lying [???] it would not have seemed to matter. but it was perfectly possible that [???] had really forgotten the photograph. and if so [???] then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it [???] and forgotten the act of forgetting. how could one be sure that it was simple trickery? perhaps that lunatic [???] in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeat ed him. [???] was looking down at him [???]. more than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promis ing child.' there is a party slog an dealing with the control of the [???]' he said.' repeat it [???] if you please.' [???] controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the [???]' repeated winston obedient ly. [???] controls the present controls the [???]' said [???] [???] nodding his head with slow approval.' is it your opinion [???] winston [???] that the past has real existence?' again the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston. his eyes flitted towards the dial. he not only did not know whether' yes' or'no' was the answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one. [???] smiled faintly.' you are no [???] [???] [???]' he said.' until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. i will put it more precise ly. does the past exist [???] [???] in space? is there somewhere or other a place [???] a world of solid objects [???] where the past is still happening?' [???]'' then where does the past exist [???] if at all?'' in records. it is written down.'' in records. [???]'' in the mind. in human memories.'' in memory. very well [???] then. we [???] the party [???] control all records [???] and we control all memories. then we control the past [???] do we not?'' but how can you stop people remembering things?' cried winston again momentarily forgetting the dial.' it is involuntary. it is outside one self. how can you control memory? you have not control led mine!' [???] manner grew stern again. he laid his hand on the dial.' on the [???]' he said [???]' you have not control led it. that is what has brought you here. you are here because you have failed in humility [???] in [???]. you would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. you prefer red to be a lunatic [???] a minority of one. only the disciplined mind can see reality [???] winston. you believe that reality is something objective [???] external [???] exist ing in its own right. you also believe that the nature of reality is [???]. when you delude yourself into thinking that you see something [???] you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. but i tell you [???] winston [???] that reality is not external. reality exists in the human mind [???] and nowhere else. not in the individual mind [???] which can make mistakes [???] and in any case soon perish es: only in the mind of the party [???] which is collective and immortal. whatever the party holds to be the truth [???] is truth. it is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the party. that is the fact that you have got to rel earn [???] winston. it needs an act of [???] [???] an effort of the will. you must humble yourself before you can become [???]' he paused for a few moments [???] as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in.' do you [???]' he went on [???]' writing in your diary [???] [???] is the freedom to say that two pl us two make [???]' [???]' said winston. [???] held up his left hand [???] its back towards winston [???] with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.'how many fingers am i holding up [???] winston?' [???]''and if the party says that it is not four but [???] how many?' [???]' the word ended in a gasp of pain. the needle of the dial had shot up to [???]. the sweat had sprung out all over [???] body. the air tore into his lungs and issu ed again in deep groans which even by [???] his teeth he could not stop. [???] watched him [???] the four fingers still extended. he drew back the le ver. this time the pain was only slightly eased.'how many fingers [???] winston?' [???]' the needle went up to sixty.'how many fingers [???] winston?'' four! four! what else can i say? four!' the needle must have risen again [???] but he did not look at it. the heavy [???] stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. the fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars [???] enormous [???] [???] [???] and seeming to [???] [???] but [???] four.'how many fingers [???] winston?'' four! stop it [???] stop it! how can you go on? four! four!''how many fingers [???] winston?'' five! five! five!''no [???] winston [???] that is no use. you are lying. you still think there are four. how many fingers [???] please?'' four! five! four! anything you like. only stop it [???] stop the pain!' abrupt ly he was sitting up with [???] arm round his shoulders. he had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. the bonds that had held his body down were loosened. he felt very cold [???] he was shaking [???] [???] his teeth were chattering [???] the tears were rolling down his cheeks. for a moment he cl ung to [???] like a baby [???] curiously comfort ed by the heavy arm round his shoulders. he had the feeling that [???] was his protector [???] that the pain was something that came from outside [???] from some other sour ce [???] and that it was [???] who would save him from it.' you are a slow learn er [???] [???]' said [???] gently.'how can i help it?' he [???].'how can i help seeing what is in front of my eyes? two and two are four.'' sometimes [???] winston. sometimes they are five. sometimes they are three. sometimes they are all of them at once. you must try harder. it is not easy to become [???]' he laid winston down on the bed. the grip of his limbs tightened again [???] but the pain had ebb ed away and the trembling had stopped [???] leaving him merely weak and cold. [???] motion ed with his head to the man in the white coat [???] who had stood [???] throughout the proceedings. the man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into [???] eyes [???] felt his pul se [???] laid an ear against his chest [???] tapped here and there [???] then he nodded to [???]. [???]' said [???]. the pain flow ed into [???] body. the needle must be at seven ty [???] [???]. he had shut his eyes this time. he knew that the fingers were still there [???] and still four. all that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over. he had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not. the pain lessened again. he opened his eyes. [???] had drawn back the le ver.'how many fingers [???] winston?'' four. i suppose there are four. i would see five if i could. i am trying to see five.'' which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five [???] or really to see them?'' really to see them.' [???]' said [???]. perhaps the needle was [???]. winston could not [???] remember why the pain was happening. behind his [???] eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance [???] weaving in and out [???] disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. he was trying to count them [???] he could not remember why. he knew only that it was impossible to count them [???] and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four. the pain died down again. when he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing. [???] fingers [???] like moving trees [???] were still stream ing past in either direction [???] cross ing and [???]. he shut his eyes again.'how many fingers am i holding up [???] winston?''i [???] know. i [???] know. you will kill me if you do that again. four [???] five [???] [???] all honesty i [???] know.' [???]' said [???]. a needle slid into [???] arm. almost in the same instant a bliss ful [???] heal ing warmth spread all through his body. the pain was already [???]. he opened his eyes and looked up grateful ly at [???]. at sight of the heavy [???] lin ed face [???] so ugly and so intelligent [???] his heart seemed to turn over. if he could have moved he would have stretch ed out a hand and laid it on [???] arm. he had never loved him so deeply as at this moment [???] and not merely because he had stopped the pain. the old feeling [???] that at bottom it did not matter whether [???] was a friend or an enemy [???] had come back. [???] was a person who could be talked to. perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. [???] had tortured him to the edge of lunacy [???] and in a little while [???] it was certain [???] he would send him to his death. it made no difference. in some sense that went deeper than friendship [???] they were [???]: somewhere or other [???] although the actual words might never be spoken [???] there was a place where they could meet and talk. [???] was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind. when he spoke it was in an easy [???] conversation al tone.' do you know where you are [???] winston?' he said.'i [???] know. i can guess. in the ministry of love.'' do you know how long you have been here?''i [???] know. days [???] weeks [???] [???] think it is months.''and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?''to make them confess.''no [???] that is not the reason. try again.''to punish them.' [???]' exclaimed [???]. his voice had changed [???] [???] and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated.'no! not merely to extract your confession [???] not to punish you. shall i tell you why we have brought you here? to cure you! to make you sane! will you understand [???] winston [???] that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. the party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. we do not merely destroy our enemies [???] we change them. do you understand what i mean by that?' he was bending over winston. his face looked enormous because of its nearness [???] and hideous ly ugly because it was seen from below. moreover it was filled with a sort of [???] [???] a lunatic [???]. again [???] heart shr ank. if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed. he felt certain that [???] was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness. at this moment [???] however [???] [???] turned away. he took a pace or two up and down. then he continued less [???]:'the first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no [???]. you have read of the religious [???] of the past. in the middle ages there was the [???]. it was a failure. it set out to [???] heresy [???] and ended by [???] it. for every heretic it burned at the stake [???] thousands of others rose up. why was that? because the [???] killed its enemies in the open [???] and killed them while they were still [???]: in fact [???] it killed them because they were [???]. men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. naturally all the glory belong ed to the vict im and all the shame to the [???] who burned him. later [???] in the twentieth century [???] there were the [???] [???] as they were called. there were the german [???] and the russian communists. the russians [???] heresy more cruel ly than the [???] had done. and they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew [???] at any rate [???] that one must not make martyrs. before they exposed their [???] to public trial [???] they deliberate ly set themselves to destroy their dignity. they wore them down by torture and solitude until they were [???] [???] [???] wretches [???] confess ing whatever was put into their mouths [???] covering themselves with abuse [???] accus ing and shelter ing behind one another [???] [???] for mercy. and yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again. the dead men had become martyrs and their [???] was forgotten. once again [???] why was it? in the first place [???] because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. we do not make mistakes of that kind. all the confessions that are uttered here are true. we make them true. and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. you must stop imagin ing that posterity will [???] you [???] winston. posterity will never hear of you. you will be lifted clean out from the stream of history. we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere. nothing will remain of you [???] not a name in a register [???] not a memory in a living brain. you will be [???] in the past as well as in the future. you will never have existed.' then why bother to torture me? thought winston [???] with a momentary bitterness. [???] check ed his step as though winston had uttered the thought aloud. his large ugly face came nearer [???] with the eyes a little narrow ed.' you are [???]' he said [???]' that since we intend to destroy you utterly [???] so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest [???] that case [???] why do we go to the trouble of [???] you first? that is what you were thinking [???] was it not?' [???]' said winston. [???] smiled slightly.' you are a flaw in the pattern [???] winston. you are a stain that must be wiped out. did i not tell you just now that we are different from the [???] of the past? we are not content with negative obedience [???] nor even with the most abject submission. when finally you sur render to us [???] it must be of your own free will. we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him. we convert him [???] we capture his inner mind [???] we re shape him. we burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side [???] not in appearance [???] but [???] [???] heart and soul. we make him one of ourselves before we kill him. it is intolerable to us that an [???] thought should exist anywhere in the world [???] however secret and power less it may be. even in the instant of death we cannot permit any [???]. in the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic [???] proclaim ing his heresy [???] exulting in it. even the vict im of the russian purg es could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. but we make the brain perfect before we blow it out. the command of the old [???] was [???] shalt [???]. the command of the [???] was [???] [???]. our command is [???] [???]. no one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. everyone is washed clean. even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once [???] [???] aaronson [???] and [???] the end we broke them down. i took part in their [???] myself. i saw them gradually worn down [???] [???] [???] grovelling [???] [???] in the end it was not with pain or fear [???] only with penitence. by the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men. there was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done [???] and love of big brother. it was touching to see how they loved him. they begged to be shot quickly [???] so that they could die while their minds were still clean.' his voice had grown almost dreamy. the [???] [???] the lunatic [???] [???] was still in his face. he is not pretend ing [???] thought winston [???] he is not a [???] [???] he believ es every word he says. what most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. he watched the heavy yet grace ful form strolling to and fro [???] in and out of the range of his vision. [???] was a being in all ways larger than himself. there was no idea that he had ever had [???] or could have [???] that [???] had not long ago known [???] examined [???] and [???]. his mind contained [???] mind. but in that case how could it be true that [???] was mad? it must be he [???] winston [???] who was mad. [???] halt ed and looked down at him. his voice had grown stern again.' do not imagine that you will save yourself [???] winston [???] however completely you sur render to us. no one who has once gone as tray is ever spar ed. and even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life [???] still you would never escape from us. what happens to you here is for ever. understand that in advance. we shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back. things will happen to you from which you could not recover [???] if you lived a thousand years. never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. everything will be dead inside you. never again will you be capable of love [???] or friendship [???] or joy of living [???] or laughter [???] or curiosity [???] or courage [???] or integrity. you will be hollow. we shall [???] you empty [???] and then we shall fill you with ourselves.' he paused and sign ed to the man in the white coat. winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head. [???] had sat down beside the bed [???] so that his face was almost on a level with [???].' three [???]' he said [???] speaking over [???] head to the man in the white coat. two soft pads [???] which felt slightly moist [???] clamped themselves against [???] temples. he [???]. there was pain coming [???] a new kind of pain. [???] laid a hand [???] [???] almost kindly [???] on his.' this time it will not [???]' he said.'keep your eyes fixed on mine.' at this moment there was a [???] [???] [???] or what seemed like an [???] [???] though it was not certain whether there was any noise. there was undoubted ly a blind ing flash of light. winston was not hurt [???] only [???]. although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened [???] he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position. a terrific pain less blow had [???] him out. also something had happened inside his head. as his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was [???] and where he was [???] and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness [???] as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.' it will not [???]' said [???].'look me in the eyes. what country is oceania at war with?' winston thought. he knew what was meant by oceania and that he himself was a citizen of oceania. he also remembered eurasia and eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not know. in fact he had not been aware that there was any war.'i [???] remember.'' oceania is at war with eastasia. do you remember that now?' [???]'' oceania has always been at war with eastasia. since the beginning of your life [???] since the beginning of the party [???] since the beginning of history [???] the war has continued without a break [???] always the same war. do you remember that?' [???]'' eleven years ago you created a leg end about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery. you pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent. no such piece of paper ever existed. you invented it [???] and later you grew to believe in it. you remember now the very moment at which you first invented it. do you remember that?' [???]''just now i held up the fingers of my hand to you. you saw five fingers. do you remember that?' [???]' [???] held up the fingers of his left hand [???] with the thumb concealed.' there are five fingers there. do you see five fingers?' [???]' and he did see them [???] for a fleet ing instant [???] before the scene ry of his mind changed. he saw five fingers [???] and there was no [???]. then everything was normal again [???] and the old fear [???] the hatred [???] and the [???] came crowd ing back again. but there had been a [???] did not know how long [???] thirty seconds [???] [???] [???] certainty [???] when each new suggestion of [???] had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth [???] and when two and two could have been three as easily as five [???] if that were what was needed. it had faded but before [???] had dropped his hand; but though he could not [???] it [???] he could remember it [???] as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of [???] life when one was in effect a different person.' you see [???]' said [???] [???]' that it is at any rate possible.' [???]' said winston. [???] stood up with a satisfied air. over to his left winston saw the man in the white coat break an [???] and draw back the [???] of a [???]. [???] turned to winston with a smile. in almost the old manner he re settled his spectacles on his nose.' do you remember writing in your [???]' he said [???]' that it did not matter whether i was a friend or an enemy [???] since i was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to? you were right. i enjoy talking to you. your mind appeals to me. it resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane. before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions [???] if you choose.''any question i like?' [???]' he saw that [???] eyes were upon the dial.' it is [???] off. what is your first question?'' what have you done with julia?' said winston. [???] smiled again.' she betrayed you [???] winston. [???]. i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so prompt ly. you would hardly recognize her if you saw her. all her rebelliousness [???] her deceit [???] her folly [???] her [???] has been burned out of her. it was a perfect conversion [???] a text book case.'' you tortured her?' [???] left this un answered.' next [???]' he said.' does big brother exist?''of course he exists. the party exists. big brother is the [???] of the party.'' does he exist in the same way as i exist?'' you do not [???]' said [???]. once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. he knew [???] or he could imagine [???] the arguments which proved his own non existence; but they were nonsense [???] they were only a play on words. did not the statement [???]' you do not exist' [???] contain a [???] absurdity? but what use was it to say so? his mind [???] as he thought of the [???] [???] mad arguments with which [???] would [???] him.'i think i [???]' he said wearily.'i am conscious of my own identity. i was born and i shall die. i have arms and legs. i occupy a particular point in space. no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously. in that sense [???] does big brother exist?'' it is of no importance. he exists.'' will big brother ever die?''of course not. how could he die? next question.'' does the brotherhood exist?'' that [???] winston [???] you will never know. if we choose to set you free when we have finished with you [???] and if you live to be ninety years old [???] still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no. as long as you live it will be an [???] riddle in your mind.' winston lay silent. his breast rose and fell a little faster. he still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. he had got to ask it [???] and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. there was a trace of [???] in [???] face. even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gle am. he knows [???] thought winston suddenly [???] he knows what i am going to ask! at the thought the words burst out of him:' what is in room 101?' the expression on [???] face did not change. he answered dri ly:' you know what is in room 101 [???] winston. everyone knows what is in room 101.' he raised a finger to the man in the white coat. evidently the session was at an end. a needle jerked into [???] arm. he sank almost instantly into deep sleep. chapter 3' there are three stag es in your [???]' said [???].' there is learning [???] there is understanding [???] and there is acceptance. it is time for you to enter upon the second stage.' as always [???] winston was lying flat on his back. but of late his bonds were looser. they still held him to the bed [???] but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. the dial [???] also [???] had grown to be less of a terror. he could evade its pangs if he was [???] enough: it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that [???] pulled the le ver. sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. he could not remember how many sessions there had been. the whole process seemed to stretch out over a long [???] in definite [???] [???] [???] the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days [???] sometimes only an hour or two.' as you lie [???]' said [???] [???]' you have often [???] have even asked [???] the ministry of love should exp end so much time and trouble on you. and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question. you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived in [???] but not its under lying motives. do you remember writing in your diary [???] [???] understand how: i do not understand [???]? it was when you thought about [???] [???] that you doubted your own sanity. you have read the book [???] [???] book [???] or parts of it [???] at least. did it tell you anything that you did not know already?'' you have read it?' said winston.'i wrote it. that is to say [???] i [???] in writing it. no book is produced individual ly [???] as you know.'' is it true [???] what it says?'' as description [???] yes. the [???] it sets forth is nonsense. the secret [???] of [???] gradual spread of [???] a [???] [???] overthrow of the party. you foresaw yourself that that was what it would say. it is all nonsense. the [???] will never revolt [???] not in a thousand years or a million. they cannot. i do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. if you have ever cherish ed any dreams of violent [???] [???] you must abandon them. there is no way in which the party can be overthrown. the rule of the party is for ever. make that the [???] of your thoughts.' he came clos er to the bed.'for ever!' he repeated.'and now let us get back to the question of [???] [???] and [???]. you understand well enough how the party maintains itself in power. now tell me why we cling to power. what is our motive? why should we want power? go on [???] [???]' he added as winston remained silent. nevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two. a feeling of weariness had overwhel med him. the faint [???] mad gle am of [???] had come back into [???] face. he knew in advance what [???] would say. that the party did not seek power for its own ends [???] but only for the good of the majority. that it sought power because men in the mass were frail [???] cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth [???] and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness [???] and that [???] for the great bulk of mankind [???] happiness was better. that the party was the eternal guardian of the weak [???] a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come [???] sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. the terrible thing [???] thought winston [???] the terrible thing was that when [???] said this he would believe it. you could see it in his face. [???] knew everything. a thousand times better than winston he knew what the world was really like [???] in what [???] the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there. he had understood it all [???] weigh ed it all [???] and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. what can you do [???] thought winston [???] against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself [???] who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?' you are ruling over us for our own [???]' he said feebly.' you believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves [???] and [???]' he started and almost cried out. a pang of pain had shot through his body. [???] had pushed the le ver of the dial up to [???].' that was stupid [???] winston [???] stupid!' he said.' you should know better than to say a thing like that.' he pulled the le ver back and continued:'now i will tell you the answer to my question. it is this. the party seeks power entirely for its own sake. we are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power [???] pure power. what pure power means you will understand presently. we are different from all the [???] of the past [???] in that we know what we are doing. all the others [???] even those who resembled ourselves [???] were cowards and hypoc rites. the german [???] and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods [???] but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. they pretended [???] perhaps they even believed [???] that they had seized power unwilling ly and for a limit ed time [???] and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. we are not like that. we know that no one ever seiz es power with the intention of [???] it. power is not a means [???] it is an end. one does not establish a [???] in order to safe guard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the [???]. the object of [???] is [???]. the object of torture is torture. the object of power is power. now do you begin to understand me?' winston was struck [???] as he had been struck before [???] by the tiredness of [???] face. it was strong and fle shy and bru tal [???] it was full of intelligence and a sort of control led passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. there were [???] under the eyes [???] the skin sagged from the cheek bones. [???] leaned over him [???] deliberate ly bringing the worn face nearer.' you are [???]' he said [???]' that my face is old and tired. you are thinking that i talk of power [???] and yet i am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body. can you not understand [???] winston [???] that the individual is only a cell? the weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. do you die when you cut your [???]' he turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again [???] one hand in his pocket.'we are the priests of [???]' he said.' god is power. but at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. it is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. the first thing you must realize is that power is collective. the individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. you know the party slog an: [???] is [???]. has it ever occurred to you that it is [???]? slavery is freedom. [???] human being is always defeat ed. it must be so [???] because every human being is doom ed to die [???] which is the greatest of all failures. but if he can make complete [???] utter submission [???] if he can escape from his identity [???] if he can mer ge himself in the party so that he is the party [???] then he is [???] and immortal. the second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings. over the [???] [???] above all [???] over the mind. power over [???] reality [???] as you would call [???] not important. already our control over matter is absolute.' for a moment winston ignor ed the dial. he made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position [???] and merely succeeded in wrench ing his body painful ly.' but how can you control matter?' he burst out.' you [???] even control the clim ate or the law of gravity. and there are disease [???] pain [???] [???]' [???] silenced him by a movement of his hand.'we control matter because we control the mind. reality is inside the skull. you will learn by degrees [???] winston. there is nothing that we could not do. invisibility [???] [???]. i could flo at off this floor like a so ap bubble if i wish to. i do not wish to [???] because the party does not wish it. you must get rid of those [???] ideas about the laws of nature. we make the laws of nature.'' but you do not! you are not even masters of this plan et. what about eurasia and eastasia? you have not conquered them yet.' [???]. we shall conquer them when it suits us. and if we did not [???] what difference would it make? we can shut them out of existence. oceania is the world.'' but the world itself is only a speck of dust. and man is [???]! how long has he been in existence? for millions of years the earth was [???]'' nonsense. the earth is as old as we are [???] no older. how could it be older? nothing exists except through human consciousness.'' but the rocks are full of the bones of extinct [???] and [???] and enormous [???] which lived here long before man was ever heard of.'' have you ever seen those bones [???] winston? of course not. [???] [???] invented them. before man there was nothing. after man [???] if he could come to an end [???] there would be nothing. outside man there is nothing.'' but the whole universe is outside us. look at the stars! some of them are a million [???] away. they are out of our reach for ever.'' what are the stars?' said [???] indifferent ly.' they are bits of fire a few [???] away. we could reach them if we wanted to. or we could blot them out. the earth is the centre of the universe. the sun and the stars go round it.' winston made another [???] movement. this time he did not say anything. [???] continued as though answering a spoken objection:'for certain purposes [???] of course [???] that is not true. when we [???] the ocean [???] or when we predict an eclipse [???] we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of [???] away. but what of it? do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a du al system of [???]? the stars can be near or distant [???] according as we need them. do you suppose our [???] are une qual to that? have you forgotten doublethink?' winston shr ank back upon the bed. whatever he said [???] the swift answer crush ed him like a [???]. and yet he knew [???] he knew [???] that he was in the right. the belief that nothing exists outside your own [???] there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy? there was even a name for it [???] which he had forgotten. a faint smile [???] the corners of [???] mouth as he looked down at him.'i told you [???] [???]' he said [???]' that [???] is not your strong point. the word you are trying to think of is [???]. but you are mistaken. this is not [???]. collective [???] [???] if you like. but that is a different thing: in fact [???] the opposite thing. all this is a [???]' he added in a different tone.'the real power [???] the power we have to fight for night and day [???] is not power over things [???] but over men.' he paused [???] and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster question ing a promis ing pupil:'how does one man ass ert his power over another [???] winston?' winston thought.'by making him [???]' he said.' exactly. by making him suffer. obedience is not enough. unless he is suffering [???] how can you be sure that he is obey ing your will and not his own? power is in [???] pain and [???]. power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. do you begin to see [???] then [???] what kind of world we are creating? it is the exact opposite of the stupid [???] [???] that the old reformers imagined. a world of fear and treachery and torment [???] a world of tramp ling and being tramp led upon [???] a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. the old [???] claim ed that they were found ed on love or justice. ours is found ed upon hatred. in our world there will be no emotions except fear [???] rage [???] triumph [???] and [???]. everything else we shall [???]. already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution. we have cut the links between child and parent [???] and between man and man [???] and between man and woman. no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. but in the future there will be no wives and no friends. children will be taken from their mothers at birth [???] as one takes eggs from a hen. the sex instinct will be [???]. [???] will be an annual formality like the renew al of a ration card. we shall abolish the orgasm. our [???] are at work upon it now. there will be no loyalty [???] except loyalty towards the party. there will be no love [???] except the love of big brother. there will be no laughter [???] except the laugh of triumph over a defeat ed enemy. there will be no art [???] no literature [???] no science. when we are [???] we shall have no more need of science. there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. there will be no curiosity [???] no enjoy ment of the process of life. all compet ing pleasures will be destroyed. but [???] not forget this [???] [???] there will be the [???] of power [???] constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. always [???] at every moment [???] there will be the thri ll of victory [???] the sensation of tramp ling on an enemy who is helpless. if you want a picture of the future [???] imagine a boot stamp ing on a human [???] ever.' he paused as though he expected winston to speak. winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again. he could not say anything. his heart seemed to be frozen. [???] went on:'and remember that it is for ever. the face will always be there to be stamp ed upon. the heretic [???] the enemy of society [???] will always be there [???] so that he can be defeat ed and [???] over again. everything that you have undergone since you have been in our [???] that will continue [???] and worse. the [???] [???] the betrayals [???] the arrests [???] the tortures [???] the executions [???] the [???] will never cease. it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. the more the party is powerful [???] the less it will be toler ant: the weaker the opposition [???] the tighter the [???]. goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. every day [???] at every moment [???] they will be defeat ed [???] [???] [???] ridiculed [???] sp at upon and yet they will always survive. this drama that i have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation [???] always in subtler forms. always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy [???] screaming with pain [???] broken up [???] [???] in the end utterly penitent [???] saved from himself [???] [???] to our feet of his own accord. that is the world that we are prepar ing [???] winston. a world of victory after victory [???] triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless press ing [???] press ing [???] press ing upon the ner ve of power. you are beginning [???] i can see [???] to realize what that world will be like. but in the end you will do more than understand it. you will accept it [???] welcome it [???] become part of it.' winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak.' you [???]' he said weak ly.' what do you mean by that remark [???] winston?'' you could not create such a world as you have just described. it is a dream. it is impossible.'

[???]''if you are a man [???] winston [???] you are the last man. your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. do you understand that you are alone? you are outside history [???] you are [???]' his manner changed and he said more harsh ly:'and you consider yourself moral ly superior to us [???] with our lies and our cruelty?'' yes [???] i consider myself [???]' [???] did not speak. two other voices were speaking. after a moment winston recognized one of them as his own. it was a [???] of the conversation he had had with [???] [???] on the night when he had enrolled himself in the brotherhood. he heard himself promis ing to lie [???] to steal [???] to forge [???] to murder [???] to encourage [???] and [???] [???] to [???] [???] diseases [???] to throw [???] in a [???] face. [???] made a small impatient gesture [???] as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making. then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.'get up from that [???]' he said. the bonds had loosened themselves. winston lower ed himself to the floor and stood up un steadily.' you are the last [???]' said [???].' you are the guardian of the human spirit. you shall see yourself as you are. take off your clothes.' winston und id the bit of string that held his overalls together. the zip fastener had long since been wrench ed out of them. he could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags [???] just [???] as the [???] of under clothes. as he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a [???] mirror at the far end of the room. he approach ed it [???] then stopped short. an involuntary cry had broken out of him.'go [???]' said [???].'stand between the wings of the mirror. you shall see the side view as well.' he had stopped because he was frightened. a bow ed [???] [???] [???] [???] thing was coming towards him. its actual appearance was frightening [???] and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. he moved clos er to the glass. the [???] face seemed to be [???] [???] because of its bent carriage. a forlorn [???] [???] face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp [???] a crooked nose [???] and [???] cheek bones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. the cheeks were sea med [???] the mouth had a [???] look. certainly it was his own face [???] but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. the emotions it [???] would be different from the ones he felt. he had gone partial ly bald. for the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well [???] but it was only the scalp that was grey. except for his hands and a circle of his face [???] his body was grey all over with ancient [???] ingrained dirt. here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds [???] and near the ank le the [???] ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin pee ling off it. but the truly frightening thing was the [???] of his body. the bar rel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a [???]: the legs had shr unk so that the knees were thick er than the thighs. he saw now what [???] had meant about seeing the side view. the [???] of the spine was astonish ing. the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest [???] the [???] neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. at a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty [???] suffering from some malign ant disease.' you have thought [???]' said [???] [???]' that my [???] face of a member of the inner [???] old and worn. what do you think of your own face?' he seized [???] shoulder and sp un him round so that he was fac ing him.'look at the condition you are in!' he said.'look at this filthy grime all over your body. look at the dirt between your toes. look at that disgu sting running sore on your leg. do you know that you st ink like a go at? probably you have ceased to notice it. look at your [???]. do you see? i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your [???]. i could sn ap your neck like a car rot. do you know that you have lost [???] [???] since you have been in our hands? even your hair is coming out in [???]. look!' he pluck ed at [???] head and brought away a tuft of hair.' open your mouth. nine [???] ten [???] eleven teeth left. how many had you when you came to us? and the few you have left are dropping out of your head. look here!' he seized one of [???] remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger. a twin ge of pain shot through [???] jaw. [???] had wrench ed the loose tooth out by the roots. he toss ed it across the cell.' you are rotting [???]' he said;' you are falling to pieces. what are you? a bag of filth. now turn around and look into that mirror again. do you see that thing fac ing you? that is the last man. if you are human [???] that is humanity. now put your clothes on again.' winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined. then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruin ed body overcame him. before he knew what he was doing he had [???] on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. he was aware of his ugliness [???] his [???] [???] a bundle of bones in filthy under clothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself. [???] laid a hand on his shoulder [???] almost kindly.' it will not last for [???]' he said.' you can escape from it whenever you choose. everything depends on yourself.'' you did it!' [???] winston.' you reduced me to this state.''no [???] winston [???] you reduced yourself to it. this is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the party. it was all contained in that first act. nothing has happened that you did not [???]' he paused [???] and then went on:'we have beaten you [???] winston. we have broken you up. you have seen what your body is like. your mind is in the same state. i do not think there can be much pride left in you. you have been kick ed and flogged and [???] [???] you have screamed with pain [???] you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. you have [???] for mercy [???] you have betrayed everybody and everything. can you think of a single [???] that has not happened to you?' winston had stopped weeping [???] though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. he looked up at [???].'i have not betrayed [???]' he said. [???] looked down at him thought fully. [???]' he said;'no; that is perfectly true. you have not betrayed julia.' the peculiar reverence for [???] [???] which nothing seemed able to destroy [???] flood ed [???] heart again. how intelligent [???] he thought [???] how intelligent! never did [???] fail to understand what was said to him. anyone else on earth would have answered prompt ly that he had betrayed julia. for what was there that they had not screw ed out of him under the torture? he had told them everything he knew about her [???] her habits [???] her character [???] her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings [???] all that he had said to her and she to him [???] their [???] meals [???] their adulteries [???] their vague [???] against the [???]. and yet [???] in the sense in which he intended the word [???] he had not betrayed her. he had not stopped loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. [???] had seen what he meant without the need for explanation.' tell [???]' he said [???]'how soon will they shoot me?'' it might be a long [???]' said [???].' you are a difficult case. but [???] give up hope. everyone is cu red sooner or later. in the end we shall shoot you.' chapter 4 he was much better. he was growing fat ter and stronger every day [???] if it was proper to speak of days. the white light and the hum ming sound were the same as ever [???] but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. there was a pillow and a [???] on the plank bed [???] and a stool to sit on. they had given him a bath [???] and they allowed him to wash himself fairly [???] in a tin basin. they even gave him warm water to wash with. they had given him new under clothes and a clean suit of overalls. they had dressed his [???] ulcer with sooth ing [???]. they had pulled out the [???] of his teeth and given him a new set of [???]. weeks or months must have passed. it would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time [???] if he had felt any interest in doing so [???] since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. he was getting [???] he judged [???] three meals in the [???] hours; sometimes he wondered dim ly whether he was getting them by night or by day. the food was surprisingly good [???] with meat at every third meal. once there was even a packet of cigarettes. he had no matches [???] but the [???] guard who brought his food would give him a light. the first time he tried to smoke it made him sick [???] but he persever ed [???] and sp un the packet out for a long time [???] smoking half a cigarette after each meal. they had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner. at first he made no use of it. even when he was awake he was completely torpid. often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring [???] sometimes asleep [???] sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. he had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. it seemed to make no difference [???] except that [???] dreams were more [???]. he dream ed a great deal all through this time [???] and they were always happy dreams. he was in the golden country [???] or he was sitting among enormous glorious [???] sun lit ruins [???] with his mother [???] with julia [???] with [???] doing anything [???] merely sitting in the sun [???] talking of peaceful things. such thoughts as he had when he was awake were most ly about his dreams. he seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort [???] now that the [???] of pain had been removed. he was not bored [???] he had no desire for conversation or distraction. merely to be alone [???] not to be beaten or question ed [???] to have enough to eat [???] and to be clean all over [???] was completely satisfy ing. by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep [???] but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gather ing in his body. he would finger himself here and there [???] trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his [???] were growing rounder and his skin [???]. finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fat ter; his thighs were now definite ly thick er than his knees. after that [???] [???] at first [???] he began [???] himself regular ly. in a little while he could walk three [???] [???] measured by pacing the cell [???] and his bow ed shoulders were growing straight er. he attempt ed more [???] exercises [???] and was astonish ed and [???] to find what things he could not do. he could not move out of a walk [???] he could not hold his stool out at [???] length [???] he could not stand on one leg without falling over. he [???] down on his heels [???] and found that with [???] pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. it was hopeless [???] he could not raise himself a [???]. but after a few more [???] few more [???] that feat was accomplish ed. a time came when he could do it six times running. he began to grow actually proud of his body [???] and to cherish an [???] belief that his face also was growing back to normal. only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the sea med [???] ruin ed face that had looked back at him out of the mirror. his mind grew more active. he sat down on the plank bed [???] his back against the wall and the slate on his knees [???] and set to work deliberate ly at the task of [???] himself. he had capitulated [???] that was agreed. in reality [???] as he saw now [???] he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. from the moment when he was inside the ministry of [???] yes [???] even during those minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to [???] had grasp ed the [???] [???] the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party. he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him like a beet le under a magnifying glass. there was no physical act [???] no word spoken aloud [???] that they had not noticed [???] no train of thought that they had not been able to infer. even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced. they had played [???] to him [???] shown him photographs. some of them were photographs of julia and himself. yes [???] [???]. he could not fight against the party any longer. besides [???] the party was in the right. it must be so; how could the immortal [???] collective brain be mistaken? by what external standard could you check its judgements? sanity was [???]. it was merely a question of learning to think as they thought. [???]! the pencil felt thick and [???] in his fingers. he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head. he wrote first in large [???] capitals: freedom is slavery then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it: two and two make five but then there came a sort of check. his mind [???] as though shy ing away from something [???] seemed unable to [???]. he knew that he knew what came next [???] but for the moment he could not recall it. when he did recall it [???] it was only by conscious ly reason ing out what it must be: it did not come of its own accord. he wrote: god is power he accepted everything. the past was alter able. the past never had been altered. oceania was at war with eastasia. oceania had always been at war with eastasia. jones [???] aaronson [???] and [???] were guilty of the crimes they were charged with. he had never seen the photograph that dis proved their guilt. it had never existed [???] he had invented it. he remembered remembering contrary things [???] but those were false memories [???] [???] of [???]. how easy it all was! only sur render [???] and everything else followed. it was like swim ming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled [???] and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of oppos ing it. nothing had changed except your own attitude: the [???] thing happened in any case. he hardly knew why he had ever rebel led. everything was easy [???] [???]! anything could be true. the [???] laws of nature were nonsense. the law of gravity was nonsense.'if i [???]' [???] had said [???]'i could flo at off this floor like a so ap [???]' winston worked it out.'if he thinks he floats off the floor [???] and if i simultaneously think i see him do it [???] then the thing [???]' suddenly [???] like a lump of [???] wreck age breaking the surface of water [???] the thought burst into his mind:' it [???] really happen. we imagine it. it is [???]' he pushed the thought under instantly. the fallacy was obvious. it pre supposed that somewhere or other [???] outside one self [???] there was a' real' world where' real' things happened. but how could there be such a world? what knowledge have we of anything [???] save through our own minds? all happenings are in the mind. whatever happens in all minds [???] truly happens. he had no difficulty in dispos ing of the fallacy [???] and he was in no danger of [???] to it. he realized [???] nevertheless [???] that it ought never to have occurred to him. the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. the process should be [???] [???] instinctive. crime stop [???] they called it in newspeak. he set to work to exercise himself in crime stop. he presented himself with [???] party says the earth is flat' [???]'the party says that ice is heavier than [???] train ed himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradict ed them. it was not easy. it needed great powers of reason ing and [???]. the [???] problems raised [???] for instance [???] by such a statement as' two and two make five' were beyond his intellectual grasp. it needed also a sort of [???] of mind [???] an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the [???] [???] errors. stupidity was as necessary as intelligence [???] and as difficult to attain. all the while [???] with one part of his mind [???] he wondered how soon they would shoot him.' everything depends on [???]' [???] had said; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. it might be ten minutes hence [???] or ten years. they might keep him for years in solitary confinement [???] they might send him to a [???] [???] they might release him for a while [???] as they sometimes did. it was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and [???] would be en acted all over again. the one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment. the [???] un spoken tradition: somehow you knew it [???] though you never heard it [???] that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the head [???] without warning [???] as you walked down a corrid or from cell to cell. one [???]' one day' was not the right expression; just as probably it was in the middle of the night: [???] fell into a strange [???] bliss ful reverie. he was walking down the corrid or [???] waiting for the bullet. he knew that it was coming in another moment. everything was settled [???] smooth ed out [???] reconciled. there were no more doubts [???] no more arguments [???] no more pain [???] no more fear. his body was heal thy and strong. he walked easily [???] with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. he was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love [???] he was in the enormous sun lit passage [???] a [???] wide [???] down which he had seemed to walk in the [???] induced by drugs. he was in the golden country [???] following the [???] across the old [???] pasture. he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face. at the edge of the field were the elm trees [???] faintly stirring [???] and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the da ce lay in the green [???] under the willows. suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. the sweat broke out on his back bone. he had heard himself cry aloud:' julia! julia! julia [???] my love! julia!' for a moment he had had an overwhel ming [???] of her presence. she had seemed to be not merely with him [???] but inside him. it was as though she had got into the texture of his skin. in that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free. also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help. he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. what had he done? how many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness? in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. they could not let such an out burst go [???]. they would know now [???] if they had not known before [???] that he was breaking the agree ment he had made with them. he obey ed the party [???] but he still hated the party. in the old days he had hidden a heretic al mind beneath an appearance of [???]. now he had retreat ed a step further: in the mind he had [???] [???] but he had hoped to keep the inner heart [???]. he knew that he was in the wrong [???] but he prefer red to be in the wrong. they would understand [???] would understand it. it was all confessed in that single foolish cry. he would have to start all over again. it might take years. he ran a hand over his face [???] trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. there were deep furrows in the cheeks [???] the cheek bones felt sharp [???] the nose [???]. besides [???] since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth. it was not easy to preserve [???] when you did not know what your face looked like. in any case [???] mere control of the features was not enough. for the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself. you must know all the while that it is there [???] but until it is needed you must never let it [???] into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name. from now onwards he must not only think right; he must feel right [???] dream right. and all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet [???] with the rest of him [???] a kind of cy st. one day they would dec ide to shoot him. you could not tell when it would happen [???] but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. it was always from behind [???] walking down a corrid or. ten seconds would be enough. in that time the world inside him could turn over. and then suddenly [???] without a word uttered [???] without a check in his step [???] without the changing of a line in his [???] the [???] would be down and bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. and almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet [???] too late [???] or too early. they would have blown his brain to pieces before they could re claim it. the heretic al thought would be [???] [???] [???] [???] out of their reach for ever. they would have blown a hole in their own perfection. to die hat ing them [???] that was freedom. he shut his eyes. it was more difficult than accept ing an intellectual discipline. it was a question of [???] himself [???] [???] himself. he had got to [???] into the filthiest of filth. what was the most horrible [???] sickening thing of all? he thought of big brother. the enormous face( because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a met re wide) [???] with its heavy black [???] and the eyes that followed you to and fro [???] seemed to flo at into his mind of its own accord. what were his true feelings towards big brother? there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. the steel door sw ung open with a cl ang. [???] walked into the cell. behind him were the [???] officer and the [???] guards.'get [???]' said [???].'come here.' winston stood opposite him. [???] took [???] shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely.' you have had thoughts of deceiv ing [???]' he said.' that was stupid. stand up straight er. look me in the face.' he paused [???] and went on in a gentler tone:' you are improving. intellectual ly there is very little wrong with you. it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. tell me [???] [???] remember [???] no lies: you know that i am always able to detect a [???] me [???] what are your true feelings towards big brother?''i hate him.'' you hate him. good. then the time has come for you to take the last step. you must love big brother. it is not enough to obey him: you must love him.' he released winston with a little push towards the guards.'room [???]' he said. chapter 5 at each stage of his imprisonment he had known [???] or seemed to know [???] whereabouts he was in the window less building. possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. the cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level. the room where he had been [???] by [???] was high up near the roof. this place was many metres underground [???] as deep down as it was possible to go. it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. but he hardly noticed his [???]. all he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him [???] each covered with green baize. one was only a met re or two from him [???] the other was further away [???] near the door. he was strapped upright in a chair [???] so tight ly that he could move nothing [???] not even his head. a sort of pad gripped his head from behind [???] forc ing him to look straight in front of him. for a moment he was alone [???] then the door opened and [???] came in.' you asked me [???]' said [???] [???]' what was in room 101. i told you that you knew the answer already. everyone knows it. the thing that is in room 101 is the worst thing in the world.' the door opened again. a guard came in [???] carrying something made of wire [???] a box or basket of some kind. he set it down on the further table. because of the position in which [???] was standing. winston could not see what the thing was.'the worst thing in the [???]' said [???] [???] [???] from individual to individual. it may be burial alive [???] or death by fire [???] or by drown ing [???] or by [???] [???] or fifty other deaths. there are cases where it is some quite trivial thing [???] not even fatal.' he had moved a little to one side [???] so that winston had a better view of the thing on the table. it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a [???] mask [???] with the conc ave side outwards. although it was three or four metres away from him [???] he could see that the cage was divided length ways into two [???] [???] and that there was some kind of creature in each. they were rats.' in your [???]' said [???] [???]'the worst thing in the world happens to be rats.' a sort of [???] trem or [???] a fear of he was not certain what [???] had passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage. but at this moment the meaning of the [???] attach ment in front of it suddenly sank into him. his bowels seemed to turn to water.' you [???] do that!' he cried out in a high crack ed voice.' you [???] [???] you [???]! [???] impossible.'' do you [???]' said [???] [???]'the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams? there was a wall of blackness in front of you [???] and a roaring sound in your ears. there was something terrible on the other side of the wall. you knew that you knew what it was [???] but you dared not drag it into the open. it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.' [???]' said winston [???] making an effort to control his voice.' you know this is not necessary. what is it that you want me to do?' [???] made no direct answer. when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. he looked thought fully into the distance [???] as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind [???] back.'by [???]' he said [???]' pain is not always enough. there are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain [???] even to the point of death. but for everyone there is something [???] that cannot be contemplated. courage and cowardice are not involved. if you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. if you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. it is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. it is the same with the rats. for you [???] they are [???]. they are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand [???] even if you wished to. you will do what is required of you.'' but what is it [???] what is it? how can i do it if i [???] know what it is?' [???] picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table. he set it down carefully on the baize cloth. winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. he was in the middle of a great empty plain [???] a flat desert drench ed with sunlight [???] across which all sounds came to him out of immen se distances. yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. they were enormous rats. they were at the age when a [???] [???] grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.'the [???]' said [???] [???] still addressing his invisible audience [???]' although a rod ent [???] is [???]. you are aware of that. you will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. in some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house [???] even for five minutes. the rats are certain to attack it. within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. they also attack sick or dying people. they show astonish ing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.' there was an out burst of squeals from the cage. it seemed to reach winston from far away. the rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each other through the partition. he heard also a deep groan of despair. that [???] too [???] seemed to come from outside himself. [???] picked up the cage [???] and [???] as he did so [???] pressed something in it. there was a sharp click. winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. it was hopeless; every part of him [???] even his head [???] was held [???]. [???] moved the cage nearer. it was less than a met re from [???] face.'i have pressed the first [???]' said [???].' you understand the construction of this cage. the mask will fit over your head [???] leaving no exit. when i press this other le ver [???] the door of the cage will slide up. these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. have you ever seen a rat leap through the air? they will leap on to your face and bore straight into it. sometimes they attack the eyes first. sometimes they bur row through the cheeks and devour the tongue.' the cage was nearer; it was closing in. winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. but he fought furious ly against his panic. to think [???] to think [???] even with a split second [???] think was the only hope. suddenly the foul mu sty od our of the brutes struck his [???]. there was a violent convulsion of [???] inside him [???] and he almost lost consciousness. everything had gone black. for an instant he was insane [???] a screaming anim al. yet he came out of the blackness clutch ing an idea. there was one and only one way to save himself. he must interpose another human being [???] the body of another human being [???] between himself and the rats. the circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else. the wire door was a couple of [???] from his face. the rats knew what was coming now. one of them was leap ing up and down [???] the other [???] an old scaly grandfather of the sewers [???] stood up [???] with his pink hands against the bars [???] and fierce ly [???] the air. winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. again the black panic took hold of him. he was blind [???] helpless [???] mind less.' it was a common punishment in imperial [???]' said [???] as [???] as ever. the mask was closing on his face. the wire brush ed his cheek. and [???] [???] it was not relief [???] only hope [???] a tiny fragment of hope. too late [???] perhaps too late. but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could trans fer his [???] body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. and he was shouting frantically [???] over and over.' do it to julia! do it to julia! not me! julia! i [???] care what you do to her. tear her face off [???] strip her to the bones. not me! julia! not me!' he was falling backwards [???] into enormous depths [???] away from the rats. he was still strapped in the chair [???] but he had fallen through the floor [???] through the walls of the building [???] through the earth [???] through the oceans [???] through the [???] [???] into outer space [???] into the gulfs between the [???] away [???] away [???] away from the rats. he was light years distant [???] but [???] was still standing at his side. there was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. but through the darkness that [???] him he heard another metal lic click [???] and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open. chapter 6 the chestnut tree was almost empty. a ray of sunlight [???] through a window fell on dusty [???]. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. a tinny music trick led from the telescreens. winston sat in his usual corner [???] gazing into an empty glass. now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall. big brother is watching you [???] the caption said. [???] [???] a waiter came and filled his glass up with victory gin [???] shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. it was [???] [???] with clo ves [???] the speciality of the ca fe. winston was listening to the telescreen. at present only music was coming out of it [???] but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bullet in from the ministry of peace. the news from the african front was [???] in the extreme. on and off he had been [???] about it all day. a eurasian army( oceania was at war with eurasia: oceania had always been at war with eurasia) was moving south ward at terrifying speed. the [???] bullet in had not mentioned any definite area [???] but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was a battlefield. [???] and [???] were in danger. one did not have to look at the map to see what it meant. it was not merely a question of losing central africa: for the first time in the whole war [???] the territory of oceania itself was menaced. a violent emotion [???] not fear exactly but a sort of [???] [???] [???] flared up in him [???] then faded again. he stopped thinking about the war. in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time. he picked up his glass and drained it at a [???]. as always [???] the gin made him shud der and even ret ch slightly. the stuff was horrible. the clo ves and [???] [???] themselves disgu sting enough in their sickly way [???] could not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin [???] which dwelt with him night and day [???] was [???] mixed up in his mind with the smell of [???]- he never named them [???] even in his thoughts [???] and so far as it was possible he never [???] them. they were something that he was [???] of [???] hover ing close to his face [???] a smell that cl ung to his [???]. as the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips. he had grown fat ter since they released him [???] and had regained his old [???] [???] more than regained it. his features had thickened [???] the skin on nose and cheek bones was coarse ly red [???] even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. a waiter [???] again [???] [???] brought the chessboard and the current issue of'the times' [???] with the page turned down at the chess problem. then [???] seeing that [???] glass was empty [???] he brought the gin bottle and filled it. there was no need to give orders. they knew his habits. the chessboard was always waiting for him [???] his corner table was always reserved; even when the place was full he had it to himself [???] since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. he never even bothered to count his drinks. at ir regular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill [???] but he had the impression that they always under charged him. it would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. he had always plenty of money [???]. he even had a job [???] a sine cure [???] more [???] than his old job had been. the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. winston raised his head to listen. no bullet ins from the front [???] however. it was merely a brief announce ment from the ministry of plenty. in the preced ing quarter [???] it appeared [???] the tenth [???] [???] [???] for [???] had been [???] by 98 per cent. he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. it was a tricky ending [???] involving a couple of knights.' white to play and mate in two moves.' winston looked up at the [???] of big brother. white always mates [???] he thought with a sort of cloudy [???]. always [???] without exception [???] it is so arranged. in no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. did it not [???] the eternal [???] [???] triumph of good over evil? the huge face gazed back at him [???] full of calm power. white always mates. the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone:' you are warn ed to stand by for an important announce ment at [???]. [???]! this is news of the highest importance. take care not to miss it. [???]' the tink ling music struck up again. [???] heart stirred. that was the bullet in from the front; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming. all day [???] with little spurts of [???] [???] the thought of a smash ing defeat in africa had been in and out of his mind. he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swar ming across the [???] frontier and pour ing down into the tip of africa like a column of ants. why had it not been possible to [???] them in some way? the outline of the west african coast stood out vivid ly in his mind. he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. there was the proper spot. even while he saw the black horde racing south ward he saw another force [???] mysterious ly assembled [???] suddenly planted in their rear [???] cutting their communications by land and sea. he felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence. but it was necessary to act quickly. if they could get control of the whole of africa [???] if they had air fields and submarine bases at the cape [???] it would cut oceania in two. it might mean anything: defeat [???] break down [???] the re division of the world [???] the destruction of the party! he drew a deep breath. an extraordinary medley of [???] it was not a medley [???] exactly; rather it was successive layers of feeling [???] in which one could not say which lay er was [???] inside him. the spasm passed. he put the white knight back in its place [???] but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem. his thoughts wandered again. almost unconscious ly he traced with his finger in the dust on the table: [???]' they [???] get inside [???]' she had said. but they could get inside you.' what happens to you here is for [???]' [???] had said. that was a true word. there were things [???] your own acts [???] from which you could never recover. something was killed in your breast: burnt out [???] [???] out. he had seen her; he had even spoken to her. there was no danger in it. he knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings. he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to. actually it was by chance that they had met. it was in the park [???] on a vile [???] biting day in march [???] when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few [???] which had pushed themselves up to be [???] by the wind. he was hurry ing along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him. it struck him at once that she had changed in some [???] way. they almost passed one another without a sign [???] then he turned and followed her [???] not very eager ly. he knew that there was no danger [???] nobody would take any interest in him. she did not speak. she walked [???] away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him [???] then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. presently they were in among a clump of ragged leaf less [???] [???] useless either for conceal ment or as protection from the wind. they halt ed. it was vilely cold. the wind whistled through the twigs and fret ted the occasion al [???] [???] [???]. he put his arm round her waist. there was no telescreen [???] but there must be hidden [???]: besides [???] they could be seen. it did not matter [???] nothing mattered. they could have la in down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to. his flesh froze with horror at the thought of it. she made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to [???] herself. he knew now what had changed in her. her face was sallower [???] and there was a long scar [???] partly hidden by the hair [???] across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. it was that her waist had grown thick er [???] and [???] in a surpris ing way [???] had stiffened. he remembered how once [???] after the [???] of a rocket bomb [???] he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins [???] and had been astonish ed not only by the [???] weight of the thing [???] but by its rigidity and [???] to handle [???] which made it seem more like stone than flesh. her body felt like that. it occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been. he did not attempt to kiss her [???] nor did they speak. as they walked back across the grass [???] she looked directly at him for the first time. it was only a momentary glance [???] full of contempt and dislike. he wondered whether it was a dislike that came pure ly out of the past or whether it was [???] also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept [???] from his eyes. they sat down on two iron chairs [???] side by side but not too close together. he saw that she was about to speak. she moved her [???] shoe a few [???] and deliberate ly crush ed a twig. her feet seemed to have grown broad er [???] he noticed.'i betrayed [???]' she said bald ly.'i betrayed [???]' he said. she gave him another quick look of dislike. [???]' she said [???]' they threaten you with something something you [???] stand up to [???] [???] even think about. and then you say [???] [???] do it to me [???] do it to somebody else [???] do it to [???] [???] and perhaps you might pretend [???] afterwards [???] that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and [???] really mean it. but that [???] true. at the time when it happens you do mean it. you think [???] no other way of saving yourself [???] and [???] quite ready to save yourself that way. you want it to happen to the other person. you [???] give a damn what they suffer. all you care about is yourself.'' all you care about is [???]' he echo ed.'and after that [???] you [???] feel the same towards the other person any longer.' [???]' he said [???]' you [???] feel the same.' there did not seem to be anything more to say. the wind plaster ed their thin overalls against their bodies. almost at once it became [???] to sit there in silence: besides [???] it was too cold to keep still. she said something about catching her tube and stood up to go.'we must meet [???]' he said. [???]' she said [???]'we must meet again.' he followed [???] for a little distance [???] half a pace behind her. they did not speak again. she did not actually try to shake him off [???] but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping a breast of her. he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube station [???] but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed point less and [???]. he was overwhel med by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree ca fe [???] which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment. he had a [???] vision of his corner table [???] with the newspap er and the chessboard and the [???] gin. above all [???] it would be warm in there. the next moment [???] not altogether by accident [???] he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people. he made a [???] attempt to catch up [???] then slow ed down [???] turned [???] and made off in the opposite direction. when he had gone fifty metres he looked back. the street was not crowded [???] but already he could not distinguish her. any one of a dozen hurry ing figures might have been hers. perhaps her thickened [???] stiffened body was no longer [???] from behind.' at the time when it [???]' she had said [???]' you do mean it.' he had meant it. he had not merely said it [???] he had wished it. he had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to [???]- something changed in the music that trick led from the telescreen. a crack ed and jeering note [???] a yellow note [???] came into it. and [???] it was not happening [???] perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of [???] voice was singing:'under the spread ing chestnut tree i sold you and you sold [???]' the tears wel led up in his eyes. a passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle. he took up his glass and [???] at it. the stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouth ful he drank. but it had become the element he sw am in. it was his life [???] his death [???] and his [???]. it was gin that sank him into stup or every night [???] and gin that revived him every morning. when he woke [???] seldom before eleven hundred [???] with [???] eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken [???] it would have been impossible even to rise from the [???] if it had not been for the bottle and tea cup placed beside the bed overnight. through the midday hours he sat with [???] face [???] the bottle handy [???] listening to the telescreen. from fifteen to [???] he was a fixture in the chestnut tree. no one cared what he did any longer [???] no whistle woke him [???] no telescreen [???] him. occasionally [???] perhaps twice a week [???] he went to a dusty [???] [???] office in the ministry of truth and did a little work [???] or what was called work. he had been appointed to a [???] of a [???] which had [???] from one of the [???] [???] dealing with min or difficulties that arose in the [???] of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary. they were engaged in producing something called an interim report [???] but what it was that they were report ing on he had never definite ly found out. it was something to do with the question of whether comm as should be placed inside [???] [???] or outside. there were four others on the committ ee [???] all of them persons similar to himself. there were days when they assembled and then prompt ly dispers ed again [???] frank ly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. but there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eager ly [???] making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and [???] long memoranda which were never [???] the argument as to what they were supposedly [???] about grew [???] involved and [???] [???] with subtle [???] over [???] [???] enormous [???] [???] [???] [???] even [???] to appeal to higher authority. and then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes [???] like ghosts fa ding at [???]. the telescreen was silent for a moment. winston raised his head again. the bullet in! but no [???] they were merely changing the music. he had the map of africa behind his eyelids. the movement of the armies was a [???]: a black arrow tearing vertically south ward [???] and a white arrow [???] east ward [???] across the tail of the first. as though for re assurance he looked up at the [???] face in the [???]. was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist? his interest flagged again. he drank another mouth ful of gin [???] picked up the white knight and made a tentative move. check. but it was evidently not the right move [???] [???]- uncalled [???] a memory floated into his mind. he saw a [???] room with a vast [???] bed [???] and himself [???] a boy of nine or ten [???] sitting on the floor [???] shaking a [???] [???] and laughing [???]. his mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing. it must have been about a month before she disappeared. it was a moment of [???] [???] when the [???] hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. he remembered the day well [???] a pelting [???] drench ing day when the water stream ed down the [???] and the light in doors was too dull to read by. the bore dom of the two children in the dark [???] [???] bedroom became [???]. winston whined and grizzled [???] made fut ile demands for food [???] fret ted about the room pulling everything out of place and kick ing the [???] until the neighbours banged on the wall [???] while the younger child wail ed [???]. in the end his mother said [???]'now be good [???] and [???] buy you a toy. a lovely [???] love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain [???] to a little general shop which was still [???] open nearby [???] and came back with a cardboard box containing an out fit of snakes and ladders. he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. it was a miserable out fit. the board was crack ed and the tiny wooden di ce were so [???] that they would hardly lie on their sides. winston looked at the thing [???] and without interest. but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the [???] climb ed hopeful ly up the ladders and then came [???] down the snakes again [???] almost to the [???]. they played eight games [???] win ning four each. his tiny sister [???] too young to understand what the game was about [???] had sat propped up against a bol ster [???] laughing because the others were laughing. for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together [???] as in his earlier childhood. he pushed the picture out of his mind. it was a false memory. he was troubled by false memories occasionally. they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were. some things had happened [???] others had not happened. he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again. almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter. he had started as though a pin had run into him. a shrill [???] had pierced the air. it was the bullet in! victory! it always meant victory when a [???] preced ed the news. a sort of [???] dri ll ran through the ca fe. even the waiters had started and prick ed up their ears. the [???] had let loose an enormous volume of noise. already an excited voice was [???] from the telescreen [???] but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheer ing from outside. the news had run round the streets like magic. he could hear just enough of what was issu ing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened [???] as he had foreseen; a vast sea borne [???] had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the [???] rear [???] the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black. fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din:' vast [???] [???] [???] [???] a million [???] [???] of the whole of [???] the war within measurable distance of its [???] victory in human [???] [???] victory [???] victory!' under the table [???] feet made [???] movements. he had not stirred from his seat [???] but in his mind he was running [???] swift ly running [???] he was with the crowds outside [???] cheer ing himself deaf. he looked up again at the [???] of big brother. the [???] that best rode the world! the rock against which the hor des of asia dash ed themselves in vain! he thought how ten minutes [???] [???] only ten [???] had still been [???] in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat. ah [???] it was more than a eurasian army that had perish ed! much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love [???] but the final [???] [???] [???] heal ing change had never happened [???] until this moment. the voice from the telescreen was still pour ing forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter [???] but the shouting outside had died down a little. the waiters were turning back to their work. one of them approach ed with the gin bottle. winston [???] sitting in a bliss ful dream [???] paid no attention as his glass was filled up. he was not running or cheer ing any longer. he was back in the ministry of love [???] with everything forgiven [???] his soul white as snow. he was in the public dock [???] confess ing everything [???] [???] everybody. he was walking down the [???] corrid or [???] with the feeling of walking in sunlight [???] and an armed guard at his back. the [???] bullet was entering his brain. he gazed up at the enormous face. forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark [???]. o cruel [???] needless mis understanding! o stubborn [???] [???] exile from the loving breast! two [???] tears trick led down the sides of his nose. but it was all right [???] everything was all right [???] the struggle was finished. he had won the victory over himself. he loved big brother. the end [???]. the principles of newspeak newspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devis ed to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc [???] or english socialism. in the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication [???] either in speech or writing. the leading articles in'the times' were written in it [???] but this was a to ur de force which could only be carried out by a specialist. it was expected that newspeak would have finally [???] oldspeak( or standard english [???] as we should call it) by about the year [???]. meanwhile it gained ground steadily [???] all party members tend ing to use newspeak words and [???] constructions more and more in their everyday speech. the version in use in 1984 [???] and [???] in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary [???] was a [???] one [???] and contained many superfluous words and [???] formations which were due to be sup pressed later. it is with the final [???] perfected version [???] as [???] in the eleventh edition of the dictionary [???] that we are concerned here. the purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the [???] and mental habits proper to the [???] of ingsoc [???] but to make all other mod es of thought impossible. it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten [???] a heretic al [???] is [???] a thought [???] from the principles of [???] be literally [???] [???] at least so far as thought is depend ent on words. its vocabulary was so [???] as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could proper ly wish to express [???] while [???] all other meanings and also the possibility of arriv ing at them by indirect methods. this was done partly by the invention of new words [???] but chiefly by [???] [???] words and by stripping such words as remained of un orthodox meanings [???] and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. to give a single example. the word free still existed in newspeak [???] but it could only be used in such statements as' this dog is free from lice' or' this field is free from weeds'. it could not be used in its old sense of [???] free' or [???] free' since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as [???] [???] and were therefore of necessity nameless. quite apart from the suppression of definite ly heretic al words [???] reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself [???] and no word that could be [???] with was allowed to survive. newspeak was design ed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought [???] and this purpose was indirectly assist ed by cutting the choice of words down to a [???]. newspeak was found ed on the english language as we now know it [???] though many newspeak sentences [???] even when not containing [???] words [???] would be barely intelligible to an [???] of our own day. newspeak words were divided into three distinct class es [???] known as the a vocabulary [???] the b vocabulary( also called compound words) [???] and the c vocabulary. it will be simpler to discuss each class separate ly [???] but the [???] peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary [???] since the same rules held good for all three [???]. the a vocabulary. the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday [???] such things as eating [???] drinking [???] working [???] putting on [???] clothes [???] going up and down stairs [???] rid ing in [???] [???] garden ing [???] cooking [???] and the like. it was compos ed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit [???] run [???] dog [???] tree [???] sugar [???] house [???] [???] in comparison with the [???] english vocabulary their number was extremely small [???] while their meanings were far more rig idly defined. all [???] and sha des of meaning had been purg ed out of them. so far as it could be achieved [???] a newspeak word of this class was simply a [???] sound express ing one clearly understood concept. it would have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. it was intended only to express simple [???] purposive thoughts [???] usually involving concrete objects or physical actions. the gramm ar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. the first of these was an almost complete interchange ability between different parts of speech. any word in the language( in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when) could be used either as verb [???] noun [???] [???] [???] or ad verb. between the verb and the noun form [???] when they were of the same root [???] there was never any [???] [???] this rule of itself involving the destruction of many [???] forms. the word thought [???] for example [???] did not exist in newspeak. its place was taken by think [???] which did duty for both noun and verb. no [???] principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention [???] in other cases the verb. even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not [???] connected [???] one or other of them was [???] sup pressed. there was [???] for example [???] no such word as cut [???] its meaning being sufficiently covered by the [???] knife. [???] were formed by adding the suff ix- ful to the [???] [???] and [???] by adding-wise. thus for example [???] speed ful meant [???]' and speedwise meant [???]. certain of our [???] [???] [???] such as good [???] strong [???] big [???] black [???] soft [???] were retain ed [???] but their tot al number was very small. there was little need for them [???] since almost any [???] meaning could be arrived at by adding- ful to a [???]. none of the [???] [???] was retain ed [???] except for a very few already ending in-wise: the-wise termination was invariable. the word well [???] for example [???] was replaced by goodwise. in addition [???] any [???] again applied in principle to every word in the [???] be [???] by adding the aff ix un- [???] or could be strengthened by the aff ix [???] [???] or [???] for still greater [???] [???] [???]. thus [???] for example [???] uncold meant [???] [???] while [???] and [???] meant [???] respectively [???]'very cold' and [???] cold'. it was also possible [???] as in [???] english [???] to modify the meaning of almost any word by [???] [???] such as ante- [???] post- [???] up- [???] down- [???] etc. by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. given [???] for instance [???] the word good [???] there was no need for such a word as bad [???] since the required meaning was equally [???] [???] [???] by ungood. all that was necessary [???] in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites [???] was to dec ide which of them to sup press. dark [???] for example [???] could be replaced by unlight [???] or light by undark [???] according to preference. the second distinguish ing mark of newspeak gramm ar was its regularity. subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all [???] followed the same rules. thus [???] in all verbs the [???] and the past [???] were the same and ended in- ed. the [???] of steal was steal ed [???] the [???] of think was thinked [???] and so on throughout the language [???] all such forms as sw am [???] gave [???] brought [???] spoke [???] taken [???] etc. [???] being abolished. all [???] were made by adding-s or- es as the case might be. the [???] of man [???] ox [???] life [???] were mans [???] ox es [???] lifes. comparison of [???] was invariably made by adding- er [???]- est( good [???] good er [???] [???] [???] ir regular forms and the more [???] most formation being sup pressed. the only class es of words that were still allowed to inflect [???] were the pronouns [???] the [???] [???] the demonstrative [???] [???] and the [???] verbs. all of these followed their ancient usage [???] except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary [???] and the shall [???] should tenses had been dropped [???] all their uses being covered by will and would. there were also certain [???] in [???] arising out of the need for rap id and easy speech. a word which was difficult to utter [???] or was liable to be [???] heard [???] was held to be [???] facto a bad word; occasionally therefore [???] for the sake of [???] [???] extra letters were [???] into a word or an [???] formation was retain ed. but this need made itself felt chiefly in [???] with the b vocabulary. why so great an importance was attach ed to ease of [???] will be made clear later in this ess ay. the b vocabulary. the b vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberate ly [???] for political purposes: words [???] that is to say [???] which not only had in every case a political implication [???] but were intended to impose a desir able mental attitude upon the person using them. without a full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correct ly. in some cases they could be translated into oldspeak [???] or even into words taken from the a vocabulary [???] but this usually demanded a long [???] and always involved the loss of certain overt ones. the b words were a sort of verb al shorthand [???] often pack ing whole rang es of ideas into a few syllables [???] and at the same time more accur ate and forcible than ordinary language. the b words were in all cases compound words.[ compound words such as speakwrite [???] were of course to be found in the a vocabulary [???] but these were merely convenient [???] and had no special ideological colour.] they consisted of two or more words [???] or portions of words [???] wel ded together in an easily pronounce able form. the resulting [???] was always a [???] [???] and inflected according to the ordinary rules. to take a single example: the word goodthink [???] meaning [???] very rough ly [???] [???] [???] or [???] if one chose to regard it as a verb [???]'to think in an orthodox manner'. this inflected as follows: [???] [???] goodthink; past ten se and past [???] [???] [???]; present [???] [???] [???]; [???] [???] [???]; ad verb [???] [???]; verb al noun [???] [???]. the b words were not [???] on any [???] plan. the words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech [???] and could be placed in any order and [???] in any way which made them easy to pronounce while [???] their derivation. in the word cri methink [???] [???] for instance [???] the think came second [???] whereas in think pol( thought police) it came first [???] and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable. because of the great difficulty in securing [???] [???] ir regular formations were common er in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary. for example [???] the [???] forms of [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] were [???] respectively [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] [???] simply because [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] were slightly [???] to pronounce. in principle [???] however [???] all b words could inflect [???] and all inflected in exactly the same way. some of the b words had highly [???] meanings [???] barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. consider [???] for example [???] such a [???] sentence from a' times' leading article as [???] [???] ingsoc. the short est rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be:' those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full emotion al understanding of the principles of english [???]' but this is not an [???] translation. to begin with [???] in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above [???] one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc. and in addition [???] only a person thorough ly ground ed in ingsoc could [???] the full force of the word belly feel [???] which implied a blind [???] [???] acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word oldthink [???] which was [???] mixed up with the idea of wickedness and [???]. but the special function of certain newspeak words [???] of which oldthink was one [???] was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. these words [???] necessarily few in number [???] had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which [???] as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term [???] could now be scrapped and forgotten. the greatest difficulty fac ing the [???] of the newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words [???] but [???] having invented them [???] to make sure what they meant: to make sure [???] that is to say [???] what rang es of words they [???] by their existence. as we have already seen in the case of the word free [???] words which had once borne a heretic al meaning were sometimes retain ed for the sake of convenience [???] but only with the [???] meanings purg ed out of them. count less other words such as honour [???] justice [???] morality [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] science [???] and religion had simply ceased to exist. a few blank et words covered them [???] and [???] in covering them [???] abolished them. all words group ing themselves round the [???] of liberty and equality [???] for instance [???] were contained in the single word cri methink [???] while all words group ing themselves round the [???] of objectivity and [???] were contained in the single word oldthink. greater [???] would have been dangerous. what was required in a party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient he brew who knew [???] without knowing much else [???] that all nations other than his own worshipped' false gods'. he did not need to know that these gods were called ba al [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and the like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. he knew [???] and the commandments of [???]: he knew [???] therefore [???] that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. in somewhat the same way [???] the party member knew what [???] right conduct [???] and in exceedingly vague [???] generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible. his sexual life [???] for example [???] was entirely regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime [???] [???]) and goods ex [???]. sexcrime covered all sexual mis deeds whatever. it covered [???] [???] adultery [???] [???] [???] and other [???] [???] and [???] in addition [???] normal inter course practis ed for its own sake. there was no need to [???] them separate ly [???] since they were all equally [???] [???] and [???] in principle [???] all punish able by death. in the c vocabulary [???] which consisted of [???] and technical words [???] it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual [???] [???] but the ordinary citizen had no need of them. he knew what was meant by [???] is to say [???] normal inter course between man and wife [???] for the sole purpose of begetting children [???] and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was sexcrime. in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretic al thought further than the perception that it was heretic al: beyond that point the necessary words were [???]. no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically [???]. a great many were [???]. such words [???] for instance [???] as joy camp [???] camp) or [???]( ministry of peace [???] [???]. ministry of war) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. some words [???] on the other hand [???] display ed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society. an example was [???] [???] meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses. other words [???] again [???] were [???] [???] having the [???]' good' when applied to the party and' bad' when applied to its enemies. but in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere [???] and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning [???] but from their structure. so far as it could be contrived [???] everything that had or might have political [???] of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary. the name of every organization [???] or body of people [???] or doctrine [???] or country [???] or institution [???] or public building [???] was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is [???] a single easily pronoun ced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. in the ministry of truth [???] for example [???] the records department [???] in which winston smith worked [???] was called rec dep [???] the fiction department was called [???] [???] the [???] department was called [???] [???] and so on. this was not done solely with the object of saving time. even in the early decades of the twentieth century [???] [???] words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use [???] of this kind was most marked in [???] countries and [???] [???]. examples were such words as [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???]. in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively [???] but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. it was perceived that in thus [???] a name one narrow ed and [???] altered its meaning [???] by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it. the words communist [???] [???] for instance [???] call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood [???] red flags [???] [???] [???] [???] marx [???] and the paris commune. the word [???] [???] on the other hand [???] suggests merely a [???] organization and a [???] body of doctrine. it refers to something almost as easily recognized [???] and as limit ed in purpose [???] as a chair or a table. [???] is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought [???] whereas communist [???] is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. in the same way [???] the associations called up by a word like [???] are few er and more [???] than those called up by ministry of truth. this account ed not only for the habit of [???] whenever possible [???] but also for the almost [???] care that was taken to make every word easily pronounce able. in newspeak [???] [???] [???] every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. regularity of gramm ar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. and rightly so [???] since what was required [???] above all for political purposes [???] was short clipped words of [???] meaning which could be uttered rap idly and which rou sed the [???] of echo es in the [???] mind. the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. almost invariably these [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] sexcrime [???] joy camp [???] ingsoc [???] belly feel [???] think pol [???] and count less [???] words of two or three syllables [???] with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. the use of them encouraged a [???] style of speech [???] at once [???] and [???]. and this was exactly what was aim ed at. the intention was to make speech [???] and especially speech on any subject not ideologically [???] [???] as nearly as possible [???] of consciousness. for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary [???] or sometimes necessary [???] to reflect before speaking [???] but a party member called upon to make a political or [???] judgement should be able to spr ay forth the correct opinions as [???] as a machine gun [???] forth bullets. his train ing fitted him to do this [???] the language gave him an almost fool proof instrument [???] and the texture of the words [???] with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc [???] assist ed the process still further. so did the fact of having very few words to choose from. relative to our own [???] the newspeak vocabulary was tiny [???] and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devis ed. newspeak [???] indeed [???] differ ed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew small er instead of larger every year. each reduction was a gain [???] since the small er the area of choice [???] the small er the temptation to take thought. ultimately it was hoped to make [???] speech issue from the [???] without involving the higher brain centres at all. this aim was frank ly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak [???] meaning'to qu ack like a duck'. like various other words in the b vocabulary [???] duckspeak was [???] in meaning. provided that the opinions which were [???] out were orthodox ones [???] it implied nothing but praise [???] and when'the times' referred to one of the orators of the party as a [???] duck speaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment. the c vocabulary. the c vocabulary was [???] to the others and consisted entirely of [???] and technical terms. these resembled the [???] terms in use today [???] and were [???] from the same roots [???] but the usual care was taken to def ine them rig idly and strip them of [???] meanings. they followed the same [???] rules as the words in the other two [???]. very few of the c words had any [???] either in everyday speech or in political speech. any [???] work er or [???] could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality [???] but he seldom had more than a [???] of the words occurring in the other lists. only a very few words were common to all lists [???] and there was no vocabulary express ing the function of science as a habit of mind [???] or a method of thought [???] [???] of its particular branches. there was [???] indeed [???] no word for [???] [???] any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc. from the fore going account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of un orthodox opinions [???] above a very low level [???] was [???] impossible. it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind [???] a speci es of [???]. it would have been possible [???] for example [???] to say big brother is ungood. but this statement [???] which to an orthodox ear merely convey ed a [???] absurdity [???] could not have been sustain ed by reason ed argument [???] because the necessary words were not [???]. ideas [???] to ingsoc could only be entertain ed in a vague word less form [???] and could only be named in very broad terms which lump ed together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so. one could [???] in fact [???] only use newspeak for un orthodox purposes by [???] translating some of the words back into oldspeak. for example [???] all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence [???] but only in the same sense in which all men are [???] is a possible oldspeak sentence. it did not contain a [???] error [???] but it expressed a [???] [???]. that all men are of equal size [???] weight [???] or strength. the concept of political equality no longer existed [???] and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purg ed out of the word equal. in 1984 [???] when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication [???] the danger [???] existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings. in practice it was not difficult for any person well ground ed in doublethink to avoid doing this [???] but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lap se would have vanished. a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of [???] equal' [???] or that free had once meant [???] free' [???] than for instance [???] a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attach ing to queen and rook. there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit [???] simply because they were nameless and therefore [???]. and it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguish ing [???] of newspeak would become more and more [???] words growing few er and few er [???] their meanings more and more rig id [???] and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing. when oldspeak had been once and for all [???] [???] the last link with the past would have been severed. history had already been re written [???] but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there [???] im perfectly censored [???] and so long as one retain ed [???] knowledge of oldspeak it was possible to read them. in the future such fragments [???] even if they chanced to survive [???] would be [???] and [???]. it was impossible to transl ate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action [???] or was already orthodox [???] would be the newspeak expression) in tendency. in practice this meant that no book written before [???] 1960 could be translated as a whole. [???] literature could only be subject ed to ideological [???] is [???] alteration in sense as well as language. take for example the [???] passage from the [???] of [???]: we hold these truths to be [???] [???] that all men are created equal [???] that they are endowed by their creator with certain [???] rights [???] that among these are life [???] liberty [???] and the pursuit of happiness. that to secure these rights [???] governments are [???] among men [???] deriv ing their powers from the consent of the govern ed. that whenever any form of government becomes [???] of those ends [???] it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it [???] and to institute new [???]. it would have been quite impossible to render this into newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original. the nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word cri methink. a full translation could only be an ideological translation [???] whereby [???] words would be changed into a [???] on absolute government. a good deal of the literature of the past was [???] indeed [???] already being transform ed in this way. considerations of [???] made it desir able to preserve the memory of certain [???] figures [???] while at the same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of ingsoc. various writers [???] such as [???] [???] milton [???] swift [???] byron [???] dick ens [???] and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been completed [???] their original writings [???] with all else that survived of the literature of the past [???] would be destroyed. these translations were a slow and difficult business [???] and it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second decade of the [???] century. there were also large quantities of merely [???] [???] technical [???] [???] and the [???] had to be treated in the same way. it was chiefly in order to allow time for the [???] work of translation that the final adoption of newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as [???]. the end
